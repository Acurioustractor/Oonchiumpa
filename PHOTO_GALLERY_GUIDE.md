# ðŸ“¸ Photo Gallery Upload Guide

## Quick Start - Upload Your Photos

### Step 1: Prepare Your Photos
Put all your photos in a folder, for example:
```
/Users/benknight/Desktop/oonchiumpa-photos/
```

### Step 2: Create the Supabase Bucket
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** â†’ **Storage**
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Name: `gallery-photos`
4. **Public**: âœ… Yes
5. Add **SELECT** and **INSERT** policies (same as you did for story-images)

### Step 3: Upload Photos
Run this command (replace with your folder path):
```bash
node upload-gallery-photos.js /Users/benknight/Desktop/oonchiumpa-photos community-events
```

**Categories you can use:**
- `general` (default)
- `community-events`
- `on-country`
- `cultural-activities`
- `youth-programs`
- `team`

## Add Story Photos to Gallery

To add the 57 story photos to the gallery:

```bash
node add-story-photos-to-gallery.js
```

This will list all the story photos (they're already in Supabase, just need to be shown in the Photos tab).

## How It Works

```

â”œâ”€â”€ Stories Tab (23 stories)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 6 stories have photo galleries
â”œâ”€â”€ Photos Tab (empty - needs setup)
â””â”€â”€ Videos Tab (empty - needs setup)
```

â””â”€â”€ Videos Tab (for future)
```

## Photo Storage Structure

### Supabase Storage Buckets:
1. **`story-images`** - Photos embedded in stories (57 photos)
   - Used by: Story detail pages
   - Format: `stories/{story-id}/{number}.png`

2. **`gallery-photos`** - General photo gallery (your new photos)
   - Used by: Photos tab on Stories page
   - Format: `{category}/{timestamp}-{filename}.jpg`

## Example Commands

### Upload photos from Desktop:
```bash
node upload-gallery-photos.js ~/Desktop/my-photos general
```

### Upload photos with category:
```bash
node upload-gallery-photos.js /path/to/photos on-country
```

### List all story photos:
```bash
node add-story-photos-to-gallery.js
```
