However, after talking about their family connections, language and cultural ties the young person learnt that they had many family connections throughout Central Australia. Oonchiumpa was able to link MS with other family members. With the support of Oonchiumpa MS subsequently went on to develop close positive and meaningful relationships with these family members. MS hasn't re offended since and Oonchiumpa has been able to close their file. MS had a history of offending and was disconnected from family supports, culture and identity when commencing. MS had disengaged with all other service providers and was regularly on a search list as his whereabouts could not be ascertained. MS started working with Oonchiumpa and engaged really well, he was rewarded with an on country trip. While on that trip he experienced the way other Aboriginal people are establishing economic development with cultural tourism on their country. MS stated he wanted to do that with his mob and through support is now working on a similar tourism venture on his country.",

Since having discussions while on country when we went on a field trip to Atnarpa station, where we spoke of learning of self-identity. Malachi had been teased by the other clients of having no culture no language because of his light skin, he looked disempowered over their remarks, I questioned them 'just because you know language does it make you more Aboriginal than him'. One of the questions I had asked of these 2 individuals is 'what do you know of your lineage family line', 'since you're an initiated young man do you know your skin names or your own story lines'. I told Malachi it's not too late to learn these things of your family background and connection to country, I told him he's in the best position of going back to learn these things because of his family. Malachi has family that have started to reconnect back to country by opening their own school to teach the next generation of a language that was on the brink of extinction. Malachi had returned onto country with extended family members and demonstrated sharing with non-indigenous students that recently visited his homelands which I think is an improvement of his behaviour, he wanted to learn he wanted to be a part of knowledge sharing to him so he can be more empowered.",

Our young fellers do not get this opportunity with their families as many families do not have a vehicle to take them, or money to purchase food or just the ability to plan a weekend due to many family obligations and responsibilities. The young fellers were very excited seeing the cars going pass from the speed and sound of the cars and bikes going pass, waving and cheering the competitors on. The young feller made their own breakfast when we got there, picked out a quiet place without evading all the campers and trail bike riders. This spot was a safe area in well behind the safety line to see the race, and away from danger. The young fellers heard the first car racer coming from down the track, so they all ran over to the flagged off area to get a good view, they were all excited to see the first car. These young fellers were comfortable with each and in a relaxed environment to share their excitement with each other and myself, the bikes were next to come, and they were the highlight of the day.
