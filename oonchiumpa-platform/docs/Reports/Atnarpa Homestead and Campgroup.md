**[Introduction]{.underline}**

The history of Atnarpa (Loves Creek) is significant in that the building
materials for the homestead was sourced from the surrounding local
environment. The old homestead was built in 1933 with rocks from the
local area and clay from the swamps around Loves Creek. The old
stockyard is still standing and was built earlier than the homestead.
Loves Creek Station was established primarily for the purpose of a
cattle station. The practice continued for more than 100 years.

Atnarpa and Undoolya Station are the outstations of Loves Creek Station
which is now named Ross River. The land claim for the Traditional Owners
was lodged in 1994 and in July 2012 the Land Title was handed back to
the Traditional Owners the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family. Who have
formulated a plan to return as a family group to Atnarpa Outstation to
share our cultural heritage and country with others.

The pioneering Bloomfield family ran cattle and bred horses for the
Indian Remount trade (Army) during the British Empire World War II and
the Aboriginal Bloomfield family maintained their connection to land in
the Loves Creek area by practicing cultural ceremonies and rituals.

During the 1970's the Traditional Landowners started lobbying for living
spaces on the property and the CLC helped them purchase the Homestead
using ABTA (Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, now the ABA) funds in
March 1993.

Atnarpa Homestead was built from clay mixed with large stones & spinifex
grass as a binder, the walls are 2 feet thick. **Our aim** (is to
restore the homestead to its original condition using local materials if
available).

We the Bloomfield family would like to restore the old homestead as it
is very special to our family with the history of Loves Creek Atnarpa.

Atnarpa homestead is a very significant place to our family history. Our
father Henry Bloomfield grew up as a kid at Atnarpa along with his
Mother Edna Wiltshire and Father Max Bloomfield. Our grandparents Max
and Edna lived at Atnarpa worked most of their lives at Atnarpa before
moving to Ross River with Green Family.

Atnarpa is one of the outstations apart of Loves Creek station and is
situated on the top end of the Loves Creek on the Ruby gap road.

The history of Atnarpa (Loves Creek) is quite amazing the old homestead
was built in 1933 with rocks from the local area and the clay mix with
the large stones & spinifex grass as a binder. The walls which are a
metre thick allows the house in the summer to be nice and cool and in
the winter to be warm with a huge fireplace in the middle of the house.

In 1994 our family was a part of the land claim that was lodged in 1994.

Being a part of the land claim was such a privilege and an experience
like none other. We were able to listen to the stories that were told
about the land and how significant they were to us all. The traditional
songs and dances that were sung every night around the campfire showed
us a great deal of respect for our land and where we come from.

**[Native Title]{.underline}**

In July 2012, the land title was handed back to the Traditional Owners
of Loves Creek. This day was a very remarkable day in history for all
the families from Loves Creek. Unfortunately, a lot of our elders where
not there to be able to witness this historic day. Our elders would have
been very proud of us being able to get our land handed back to us.

the old homestead and was built with the river gum trees. The thickness
of the yards allowed it to be strong and stable when holding cattle.
Today the posts still stand strong with the upgrades of new logs.
