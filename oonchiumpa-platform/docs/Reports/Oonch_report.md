PROJECT EVALUATION REPORT 

 

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 


 

This evaluation assesses the impact and effectiveness of Oonchiumpa Consultancy and Services, 
Alternative Service Response (the Project), designed to support the holistic development of 
Aboriginal young people in Central Australia. Rooted in cultural authority, knowledge, traditions 
and community engagement, the project aims to empower youth by fostering a sense of identity, 
enhancing personal resilience, and equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate their 
futures in the two World’s they live in, Aboriginal and Western. 

 

Key Findings: 

• Cultural Connection: The project successfully strengthened participants’ cultural identity, 
through participation in programs and supports provided by other Aboriginal and non- 
Aboriginal businesses and services through the cultural brokerage aspect of the project 
delivery. 
• Personal Development: Participants demonstrated significant growth in confidence, and 
resilience, with many now having the life skills to enable them to participate in community 
programs and events. 
• Educational and Career Outcomes: Improved school attendance and academic 
engagement were noted, along with increased interest in pursuing employment 
opportunities. 
• Mental Health and Well- Being: Participants reported enhanced emotional well- being, 
reduced feelings of sadness and insecurity and greater access to positive mentors and role 
models. 
• Anti – social behaviour: The majority of young people were removed from the Operation 
Luna taskforce case management list. 


Challenges: 

• Increased demand to take on more young people, by young people, families, government 
and non- government services including the judiciary. 
• Increased demand to take on lead roles in case management and providing advice to 
government and non- government services, often in areas that are not funded. 
• Barriers such as the constant geographic movement of young people between town and 
community causing instability that transcends into a lack of engagement in key areas such as 
education. 


 

Recommendations: 

• Expand Reach: Increase funding and partnerships to extend the program to more young 
people and families, as well as external referrals. 
• Provide Safe Sleeping: Obtain funding and infrastructure for a residential facility to support 
safe sleeping and stable access to education, health and other supports. 
• Focus on Sustainability: Develop strategies to ensure the long- term viability of the project, 
including capacity building. 


 

 


 

 

The evaluation highlights the profound positive impact of Aboriginal- led youth services on young 
people’s lives, emphasizing their importance in fostering cultural pride, personal growth, and 
community cohesion. With continued investment and refinement, this program has the potential to 
further empower future generation of Aboriginal youth in Central Australia. 

 

2. INTRODUCTION 


 

Aboriginal- led youth services play a pivotal role in supporting the well- being, cultural identity and 
empowerment of Aboriginal young people. These programs are uniquely positioned to address the 
challenges faced by Aboriginal youth while fostering a deep connection to their heritage and community. 
By embedding traditional knowledge, practices, and values into service delivery, we create culturally 
safe spaces that nurture resilience, leadership, and personal growth. 

This evaluation aims to assess the effectiveness of Oonchiumpa Consultancy and Services, Alternative 
Service Response, as an Aboriginal- led youth service in achieving their objectives of implementing 
culturally- led support for at risk youth and their family/ kin to deliver lasting change, embed culturally- 
led ideas to effect change and improve knowledge of and implement the National Principles for Child 
Safe Organisations throughout Central Australia. 

 

By examining the outcomes and the perspectives of participants, stakeholders, and program leaders, 
this evaluation seeks to highlight successes, identify areas for improvement, and contribute to the 
ongoing development of culturally responsive youth services. The finding will provide valuable insights to 
inform future strategies, ensuring the continuous support and empowerment of Aboriginal youth in 
Central Australia. 

 

3. PROJECT OVERVIEW 


 

This project focuses on the delivery of culturally appropriate, community- driven programs designed to 
support the holistic development of Aboriginal youth. Recognising the unique challenges faced by 
Aboriginal young people, such as social, economic, and systemic barriers, this initiative prioritises the 
integration of cultural knowledge, authority, traditions, and values into all aspects of service delivery. 

The project is delivered as a mentorship program to Aboriginal young people in Central Australia who 
have been identified as being at risk by the Northern Territory Government, Operation Luna taskforce. 
The program includes a range of activities including leadership development, mental health support, 
educational assistance, and opportunities for youth to engage with strong Aboriginal mentors. This is 
done through Oonchiumpa staff as well as through brokerage activities with other Aboriginal businesses 
and services, as well as mainstream businesses and services. These services aim to strengthen cultural 
identity, foster resilience, and equip Aboriginal youth with the skills and confidence needed to navigate 
their futures successfully in the two World’s they live in, namely as an Aboriginal person in a Western 
World. 

 

The project is led by Aboriginal traditional owners and leaders of Mbantua (Alice Springs) and guided by 
community input to ensure relevance and authenticity. By addressing both immediate and long term 
needs, it seeks to empower participants, promote equity, and contribute to broader community well- 
being. This overview provides a foundation for evaluating the project’s outcomes, impact, and potential 
for future growth. 

 

4. METHODOLOGY 


 

This evaluation employs a mixed- methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research 
methods to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the projects outcomes and impact. The 
methodology is designed to respect cultural protocols and incorporate community perspectives. 

1. Data Collection Methods 



a. Discussions: Conversations with youth participants, community leaders, program 
facilitators, and Elders. These sessions aim to capture the personal experiences, 
cultural insights, and the perceived impact of the service. 
b. Surveys: Quantitative Well- Being Assessments distributed to participants gather 
data on measurable outcomes such as increased confidence, improved mental health, 
or enhanced safety and security. 
c. Observation: Direct observation of program activities to evaluate engagement 
levels, cultural alignment, and overall program delivery. 
2. Community Engagement 
a. Collaboration with community leaders and Elders to co-design evaluation tools and 
ensure alignment with cultural values and priorities. 
b. Respectful integration of Aboriginal knowledge systems and storytelling as valid 
forms of evidence. 
3. Data Analysis 
a. Quantitative Analysis: Statistical analysis of survey data to identify trends, 
correlations, and measurable outcomes. 
b. Qualitative Analysis: Thematic analysis of discussions and observations to identify 
key themed and narratives. 
4. Ethical Considerations 
a. Informed consent from all participants, with special consideration for youth and 
their guardians. 
b. Adherence to ethical guidelines, including cultural sensitivity, confidentiality, and 
the principles of “nothing about us without us”. 


 

This methodology ensures a thorough and culturally responsive evaluation process that respects the 
voices of all stakeholders and accurately reflects the impact of the project. 

 

5. FINDING AND ANALYSIS 


 

Cultural Connection 

The program has a significant impact on strengthening cultural identity and connection amongst 
participants: 

• Increased Cultural Knowledge: Participants and families who have joined our 
program get an introduction of who we are as a business and our Oonchiumpa staff and 
their families. An understanding of our cultural connections to Mbantua as Traditional 
Owners, with this helps build our connection with the young people and their families, 
gaining a deeper understanding of not only their cultural heritage, language and traditions 
but ours as well. 


 

MS stated that they were from Alice Springs on first engagement. However, after talking about their family 
connections, language and cultural ties the young person learnt that they had many family connections 
throughout Central Australia. Oonciumpa was able to link MS with other family members. With the support of 
Oonchiumpa MS subsequently went on to develop close positive and meaningful relationships with these family 
members. MS hasn’t re offended since and Oonchiumpa has been able to close their file. 

 

• Active Engagement in Culturally based Activities: Every young person has engaged 
in culturally connected activities including on country trips and yarning circles, as well as 
near daily culturally inclusive engagement around ceremony, sorry business, family 
disputes, community and town camp conflicts, wellbeing, safety and family violence. 


 

• Cultural Authority and Leadership: Participants feel a sense of responsibility to 
Oonchiumpa staff to not let them down. Consequently, they feel deep shame and regret 
when they do lapse into anti- social behaviours. Participants and their families 
consistently express the importance and success of being able to work with Aboriginal 



people and especially those that are leaders on Arrerente country. There is an undeniable 
power in the cultural authority held by Oonchiumpa staff. 
➢ Case Study: The On Country Cure 





 

Feedback from Participants: 

 

“I think other kids should work with you mob; I think everyone should work with Oonchiumpa. I like working with 
you because you mob are good and help, it’s good working with you mob.” [participant] 

 

“We will do activities with you mob because it’s with you mob, we like working with you.” [participant] 

 

“I like working with you mob because you help me” [participant] 

 

“We all green, we Oonchiumpa” [participant] 

 

“Its good stuff like this cause we get to work with people like you mob [participant] 

 

“I think it’s working really well with Freddy having the fellers and you two (Megan and Tammy) with the girls. They 
are working really well with Oonchiumpa. I think it’s going to be really good.” [participant responsible adult] 

 

J’s other caseworker came out to visit, but J didn’t want to work with him at the start she didn’t feel comfortable, but 
J enjoys working with you two she works really well, they like working with Oonchiumpa. [participant responsible 
adult] 

“CB understands since becoming a man he has more responsibility and is now becoming more a of role model and 
leader in the Town Camp. He didn’t understand the importance of his cultural role before. He is now able to reflect 
on his actions in the past and feeling remorse. He knows he can be a leader” [Oonchiumpa Team Leader] 

 

MS had a history of offending and was disconnected from family supports, culture and identity when 
commencing. MS had disengaged with all other service providers and was regularly on a search list as 
his whereabouts could not be ascertained. MS started working with Oonchumpa and engaged really 
well, he was rewarded with an on country trip. Whie on that trip he experienced the way other Aboriginal 
people are establishing economic development with cultural tourism on their country. MS stated he 
wanted to do that with his mob and through support is now working on a similar tourism venture on his 
country. 

 

Personal Development 

 

The program effectively supported the personal growth and leadership skills of Aboriginal youth: 

 

• Oonchiumpa supported two out of three eligible young people to receive youth 
allowance, promoting independence and in turn boosting their confidence. 


 

After the passing of her father M was living in a town camp with her Aunty, occasionally travelling to Yeundumu to 
be with her mother. M did not have her own room or personal belongings at her Aunty’s and anything she did have 
was often stolen by transient adults passing through. M’s mother was on a 10 year wait list for housing. Since 
working with Oonchiumpa M and her mother are living independently, having their own accommodation, M has her 
own income and is actively seeking employment. 

 

• Several young people now have the confidence to come into the Oonchiumpa office 
on their own to seek support and/ or just “hang out”. 


 

J would never come into the office without being with other young people or having been picked up by Oonchiumpa 
staff. J now will arrange her own transport to come into the office on her own to get supports and “hang out”. 

 

• Most young people are now able to articulate their needs and feelings, as well as 
advocate for themselves when required. 



 

A’s mother passed away and she was left destitute living between multiple family homes with no involvement from 
her father. A had been on Operation Luna for an extended period of time. A was very guarded and lacked 
engagement. Since working with Oonchiumpa A is very forthcoming with her needs and wants, often seeking out 
support and assistance when needed. Other services have noted the engagement of A and several other young 
people when with Oonchiumpa. In particular Oonchiumpa has been called to come into school to support A (and 
other young people) to engage. 

 

• Young people have confidence to undertake life skills related tasks such as 
ordering food at a restaurant, shopping, calling services and supports on the phone, 
school interviews and meetings. 


 

Many young people had never shopped for themselves or used the cash registers. Young people are now able to 
budget and shop for essential items with little support. Oonchiumpa has also supported young people to go to the 
bank themselves, attend Centrelink, book their own health appointments and attend school interviews. 

 

Mental Health and Well- Being 

 

The program provided critical support for emotional and mental well-being: 

• Improved Emotional Resilience: the program has conducted various activities to 
improve emotional resilience including cultural connection workshops, elder mentorship, 
resilience discussions and peer support circles. Many young people have reported feeling 
good and staff have observed changes in attitude. 
• Access to Support Services: Oonchiumpa continues to support young people’s 
engagement with mental health and wellbeing support services. We have also linked one 
of our young men The Spirit of the Gumtree Aboriginal men’s program. He has been 
participating in a 6-week program. Oonchiumpa have now assisted The Spirit of the 
Gumtree to be the young person’s main NDIS Provider, and they continue to work together. 


 

Community Feedback: Parents and guardians noted improvements in the overall 
emotional well-being of youth. 

 

“We feel more comfortable working with Oonchiumpa” [participant] 

 

“We do happy stuff like taking us on outings and do stuff with us” [participant] 

 

Oonchiumpa staff observations: 

 

“J and A were always grumpy, not wanting to do anything. But now they are just happy, they are laughing in the 
car with us, dancing, giggling. Before they were heavy and had a lot of worries now they are free to be themselves. 
Even just the smiles on their face is a huge difference”. 

 

“XN has long term health issue. Prior to working with Oonchiumpa he hadn’t had his medication for over a year. 
He now takes responsibility for his health and makes sure he has his medication 

 

“RH and DW are impacted by their parents being in and out of jail. They are starting to develop alternative coping 
mechanisms when this happens, regulate their emotions and seek support” 

 

“CB Thinks more positively, feel a sense of responsibility and self” 

 

 

Educational and Career Outcomes: 

 

The program demonstrated significant positive impacts on participants educational engagement and 
career aspirations. These outcomes align with the program’s goal of empowering youth to achieve their 
full potential through tailored support and skill- building initiatives. 

 


a. Educational Engagement and Employment 
• Improved school attendance: 
o 95% of participants had disengaged from school when the Project started, 
since working with Oonchiumpa 72% have now returned to school or alternative 
education pathways. 
o Teachers observed increased motivation and participation among students 
involved in the program. 
o 3 young people who previously showed no interest in career development 
and employment are now asking about work and training to get work. 
o One out of three eligible young people are applying for employment. 
➢ Case Study: Maybe Magdalene wanting a job. 





 

“The girls have a good connection with you and Tamara that’s why I want you to come into the classroom with them 
until they are comfortable. 

“The girls are really comfortable with you and Tamara, and they work well with you, and they listen to you.” [St 
Joseph’s School] 

 

“You know I try get these kids up for school every day try to wake them up to come with me but nothing they don’t 
get up. You mob come see them they up straight away, it’s good they listen get up straight away and get 
ready” [participant responsible adult] 

“We want to do what you’se are doing, we want to work with the youth when were older” [participants] 

 

After securing indpendant living through the support of Oonchiumpa. MS is now working towards a job. 
Oochiumpa has assisted MS in preparing a resume, writing applications and practicing interview skills. 

 

c. Long- Term Aspirations: 
• 70% of participants expressed an interest in pursuing and continuing their 
education, with many citing the program’s encouragement as a motivating factor. 
• 40% of participants expressed a desire to go to boarding school, with which the 
program is supporting them. 


 

This analysis highlights the programs success in fostering educational reengagement while emphasizing 
the need for continued support to overcome systemic barriers. 

 

Community Impacts 

 

The program has had a significant positive impact on the broader community by addressing the 
underlying causes of youth offending and promoting cultural healing and cohesion. The programs efforts 
to reduce recidivism among Aboriginal youth have contributed to safer, more resilient communities. Its 
holistic approach to assisting the whole family has also contributed to broader community cohesion and 
engagement. 

 

• Enhanced Community Safety 


By reducing recidivism, the program has contributed to a measurable decline in youth- related offences 
in the community perpertrated by the young people they are working with. 

 

Of the 21 young people referred by Operation Luna, there was 1 young person remaining on their list as of July 2024 
and from August to December 2024 of the 19 young people only 1 young person remained on the list. 

 

• Intergenerational Benefits 


The program’s support for youth has had ripple effects on families and caregivers, many of whom 
expressed reielf and optimism and their children’s futures. Some parents have been inspired to seek 
assistance or engaged in community activities, creating a positive cycle of engagement and support. 

 


• Economic and Social Outcomes 


The program focuses on skill development and education for youth has improved employability and 
school retention rates, which are expected to contribute to long- term economic benefits for the 
community. Additionally, fewer youth in the justice system means reduced costs for the broader justice 
system, easing the burden on public resources. 

 

• Community Collaboration 


The program has fostered partnerships between Aboriginal- led organisations, local schools, justice 
agencies and health services. These collaborations have strengthened the community’s capacity to 
address social issues collectively, ensuring that youth and families receive wraparound support. 

 

Oonchiumpa has extensive community collaboration through referrals and brokerage activities as listed 
below: 

• 32 referrals for girls and 39 fellas referrals. See referrals attachment. 


 

Challenges and Limitations 

 

Despite these promising outcomes, challenges remain. Many participants cited barriers such as 
unstable housing, limited educational engagement, and difficulty accessing culturally appropriate 
mental health support as factors contributing to reoffending. Additionally, systemic biases within the 
justice system continue to disproportionately affect Aboriginal youth. 

 

Some key challenges that were identified: 

• Geographic barriers: Many young people, while based in Mbantua, spend 
significant amounts of time travelling to community for family, cultural and other reasons. 
This transience interrupts engagement in many aspects of their lives including education 
and service delivery. 
• Recidivism: There are period of recidivism for young people most commonly 
marked by increased community conflict between adults, breaks in service delivery and 
the negative influence of older youth transitioning through town camps. 
• Employment: Aboriginal businesses and organisations hold a crucial role in 
employment, however they don’t have the resources to handle the influx of jobs that are 
required. Aboriginal people want to work with and for Aboriginal people. The young people 
also identify wanting to work with Aboriginal people. 


 

Recommendations: 

1. Expand cultural programs: Increase access to cultural healing practices and community- 
led initiatives such as this program to strengthen identity and resilience. 
2. Holistic Support Services: Provide wraparound services addressing housing, education, 
and employment alongside justice specific programs. 
3. Collaborative Partnerships: Strengthen partnerships with Aboriginal- led organisations to 
ensure all interventions are culturally safe and effective. 
4. Data Collection: Improve tracking of long- term recidivism outcomes to assess the 
sustained impact of the program. 


By continuing to address the root causes of reoffending and fostering culturally safe spaces, 
Oonchiumpa can build on its success and further reduce recidivism rates among Aboriginal youth. 

 

6. COMMUNITY FEEDBACK 


 

Community consultations conducted during the evaluation revealed widespread support for the 
program, with stakeholders praising its cultural relevance and holistic approach. Elders highlighted the 
importance of keeping youth connected to their roots, while local service providers acknowledged the 
program’s role in reducing demand on crisis services. 

 


Oochiumpa’s positive role in working with young people has transcended to a wave of referrals external 
to Operation Luna. 

• 10 requests for outside referrals, including 8 requests to take on young people from defunded 
programs and 2 requests from courts and lawyers. 


 

Recommendations 

1. Expand Outreach: Increase the program’s visibility within the community to engage more 
youth and families. 
2. Sustain Collaboration: Maintain and strengthen partnerships with local organisations to 
provide comprehensive support. 
3. Long- term Evaluation: Assess the program’s impact over a longer timeframe to fully 
capture intergenerational and community- wide benefits. 


By empowering youth and addressing systemic drivers of offending. The program has contributed to a 
stronger, safer, and more culturally connected community. 

 

7. PROGRAM REACH AND RETENTION 


 

The program successfully engaged a diverse group of Aboriginal youth, reaching 19 participants during 
the evaluation period, 9 male and 10 female, of that 8 males and 4 females were existing clients from 
last reporting period. The age range is between 11 and 17 years old. The program demonstrated success 
in engaging youth from Town Camps who come from language groups outside of Mbantua, with 52% of 
participants coming from those areas, particularly language groups of Western Arrernte and Luritja. 

 

Key outreach strategies included: 

• Working with local schools and community organisations. 
• Consulting Elders and community leaders to foster trust and encourage 
participation. 
• Utilising culturally appropriate materials and communication methods, such as 
storytelling and art, to explain program benefits. 


Despite these achievements, there were challenged engaging some groups, such as youth in highly 
transient families or those disconnected from community networks. 

 

Program Retentions 

Retention rates were strong, with 90% of participants engaging consistently with the program. Among the 
4 males and 5 females who were exited at the start of the reporting period, 100% cited reasons such as 
family relocation, over servicing or personal challenges. Three of the males were exited due to non- 
engagement and attendance at men’s ceremonies. However, since returning from those responsibilities 
we have had requests for 3 of them to be re- referred. One female has also requested to re- engaged with 
Oonchiumpa. 

 

Factors contributing to high retention included: 

• Cultural Relevance: Activities grounded in Aboriginal traditions, such as cultural 
camps, art, and connection to country, helped participants feel valued and engaged. 
• Supportive Relationships: Regular mentorship from Aboriginal program staff 
provided a sense of stability and trust. 
• Holistic Support Services: Access to transportation, meals, and mental health 
support addressed barriers that could have hindered participation. 


Feedback from participants highlights that the program’s culturally safe and inclusive environment was 
a primary reason for their continued involvement. 

 

Opportunities for Improvement 

To further enhance reach and retention, the following strategies are recommended: 

1. Targeted Outreach: Develop additional partnerships in communities to engage youth who 
are transient. 



2. Retention tracking: implement regular check- ins with participants to identify and address 
potential barriers to continued engagement. 


By expanding its reach and maintaining strong retentions, the program can ensure more Aboriginal youth 
benefit from its culturally informed and supportive services.

Good News Story 

Atnarpa Homestead and Campground Girls Day Trip 

On the 3 July Katrina took the young girls out to Atnarpa Homestead and Campground to be apart of the on country 
program with the traditional owners of Atnarpa. 

This was an opportunity to share an insight of what the young traditional owners are doing on their country working 
and share their cultural and land with the many interstate students apart of the Red Earth social enterprise. 

These two young are Luritja country and to be welcomed on eastern Arrernte country by young traditional owners 
was a privilege. 

This type of insight gives our young people the strength to be able to want to a part of similar program on their 
country.

Oounchuimpa Pottery Lesson 

On Tuesday the 24th of September apart of the Oonchuimpa holiday program. Oochiumpa staff picked 
up Bonika , Latarna and Tyereesa, Jonkia and Kayana up from Anthepe. 

 All girls participated in our holiday programs we booked with Tahlia who has her own Arts & Craft 
course. The lesson today was pottery making, the girls learnt how to make bowls, shape and join the 
clay. 

The girls really enjoyed this session as it was relaxing and gave them an opportunity to sit in silence and 
feel the clay through hands. They enjoyed the session, and we will book future sessions with Tahlia.

Oonchiumpa School Holiday Program: 

During the September 2024 school holiday’s Oonchiumpa provided a school holiday program for the 
young people. 

Monday 23 September 2024 Oonchiumpa participated in the Yipirinya sunset holiday program and joined 
with their cooking class. We had 4 of our young people Latarna, Bonika, Tyereesa, and Hudson along with 
other young people of the community. 

There, they met Miss Dan, who shared stories about her hometown of China and culture, explaining its 
significance to her. 

Afterward, Miss Dan and the team took the kids to Ling’s supermarket and Woolworths to pick up the 
ingredients for their dumplings. Once back at the school, the kids learned how to fold and prepare the 
dumplings. 

This was a great opportunity for young people to ask 
questions.

Atnarpa Homestead and Campground Fellas Day Trip 

We spoke of how you could take what they’ve had experienced while visiting Atnarpa Station Field Trip back to your 
homelands and start learning from family. How each client saw young proud members demonstrating and sharing 
their knowledge of making bush medicines that has been passed down from their elders, storytelling and the 
sharing the history of that area. 

Since having discussions while on country when we went on a field trip to Atnarpa station, where we spoke of 
learning of self-identity. Malachi had been teased by the other clients of having no culture no language because of 
his light skin, he looked disempowered over their remarks, I questioned them “just because you know language 
does it make you more Aboriginal than him”. 1 of the question I had asked of these 2 individuals is “what do you 
know of your lineage family line”, “since you’re an initiated young man do you know your skin names or your own 
story lines”. 

I told Malachi it’s not too late to learn these things of your family background and connection to country, I told him 
he’s in the best position of going back to learn these things because off he’s family. Malachi has family that have 
started to reconnect back to country by opening their own school to teach the next generation of a language that 
was on the brink of extinction. 

Malachi had returned onto country with extended family members and demonstrated sharing with non-indigenous 
students that recently visited he’s homelands which I think is an improvement of his behaviour, he wanted to learn 
he wanted to be a part of knowledge sharing to him so he can be more empowered. This is cultural significance of 
how he has demonstrated and the empowerment of strong family culture connections on country. 

Fellas on Country Day Trip – Finke Desert Race 

The Finke Desert Race King’s Birthday long weekend in Alice Springs, were people come from all over the country to 
compete in the motor bike and buggy race to the Aboriginal Community Finke Community. 

 

Our young fellers were up early for a 7am departure from Alice Springs down the Finke track. The cars/buggies were the 
first to head off on their 3ookm race down south to the Finke community. Our young fellers do not get this opportunity 
with their families as many families do not have a vehicle to take them, or money to purchase food or just the ability to 
plan a weekend dure to many family obligations and responsibilities. The young fellers were very excited seeing the cars 
going pass from the speed and sound of the cars and bikes going pass, waving and cheering the competitors on. 

 

The young feller made their own breakfast when we got there, picked out a quiet place without evading all the campers 
and trail bike riders. This spot was a safe area in well behind the safety line to see the race, and away from danger. 

 

The young fellers heard the first car racer coming from down the track, so they all ran over to the flagged off area to get 
a good view, they were all excited to see the first car. These young fellers were comfortable with each and in a relaxed 
environment to share their excitement with each other and myself, the bikes were next to come, and they were the 
highlight of the day. We then made some lunch and enjoyed the day telling stories having a laugh, they all wished to 
have camped for the night. The young fellers were very appreciative and thanked me for taking them out on country for 
a great day.
