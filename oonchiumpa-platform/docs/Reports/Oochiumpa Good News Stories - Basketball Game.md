**Good News Story Oonchiumpa**

The girls enjoyed an afternoon out with Katrina watching the semi-final
for under 16 cruiser boys.

interest to play basketball next season. This was an opportunity for the
girls to try something new and be apart of the local competition and the
basketball community. This was the first time that some of the girls
have ever been inside the basketball stadium, Katrina had 5 girls who
are on our Oonchiumpa team/list and 1 who is the sister of one of the
girls.
