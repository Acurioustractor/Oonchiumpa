Kristy Full Interview

[00:00:00] I think going into the fourth year compared to the first year starting off under Naja was very challenging because not only did we have to go through barriers in terms of, management to be able to tick off.

What we can do and what I had envisioned to do for this course this time round and the last two courses, we've been pretty successful in terms of not having that management to deal with which has been easier for us. So Chupa took on true justice in 2002. Oh, and then, so this is our fourth year going in 2003, I think.

Fourth year going in. And so it's exciting because one thing that we've decided to do is do an alternative approach this time. And we've coming from the perspective of ban [00:01:00] people are under country and talking about. The challenges within Inba and Central Australia what's the passion?

Yeah, I think, look, I think every year we have some amazing students that are a part of the course. And that what, that's what keeps us going because, if we pull out or if we, we're unable to do this, they're our next future, legal and government and rule makers. So we wanna be able to continue this, but.

Also just give them a glimpse of what's happening. Reality for us as aboriginal people, the challenges that we're faced with on a daily. And I think for us here in Central Australia, we wanna be able to create generational wealth, economic development on our own land. We see too many times that, a lot of other businesses are thriving.

Why [00:02:00] can't we thrive as Aboriginal people on our land as well? 

. I think one thing that we knew we wanted from the get go was to have, perspective and for our students to hear firsthand from traditional learners, from elders, from many different language groups and also the prominent and leaders that.

We know that are working in collaboration with us to, to get the best outcome for aboriginal people in town. So many different language groups, surrounding groups, language groups, men's perspective, women's perspective. So it creates an opportunity to, for all our students to hear firsthand from many different, language groups and a range of genders and ages as well.

I think we definitely wanna be able to continue this partnership with a NU, a NU being in Canberra where parliament is, these young students are passionate. These young students have been working within government [00:03:00] in Canberra.

So a lot of those students are in. Roles now that making decisions for Central Australia. So it is really meaningful to have, these young lawyers to be able to hear firsthand from our perspective here and not listening to the media narrative. So we wanna change that narrative. 

So we have been asked, previously from other students that they're, parents are part of the other universities that are interested as well and what that looks like. I think we definitely wanna be, we're definitely open to having those students and those other university partnerships as well.

I think the legal system is a bit far behind in terms of, having these meaningful training programs, having these meaningful courses to, for young lawyers and even new lawyers coming out into, there's no real [00:04:00] meaningful course or program for them to part participate.

We've also spoken to. Hosting the Aboriginal, judges, judiciary as well. So these are things that we wanna be able to share our knowledge and our experience and our elders stories and our struggles as well. 

I definitely think there's an opportunity for us to share, our self-determination, what we wanted to be able to create on our communities and our, stations and our land. We wanna be able to invite people to see our vision just as much as what they can see out on our land.

So there's so much opportunities that we definitely invite a lot of our, guests to come and be a part of what we are trying to change here. We know there's a lot of. Cattle industries around, we know that there's a lot of mining industries around. Okay. So how are you going to empower us as aboriginal people to [00:05:00] be sustainable in the future for our next generation.

Unfortunately, a lot of our young people, do not have a are currently living in overcrowding housing.

Currently living with the influx of different family members, traveling and traveling from community to stay with them. So it really is a struggle, because a lot of the family members are quite often, eating the food in their house and sleeping on their beds and are taking over their household.

So I think it's important for us to have a safe home. And for our young people to feel like a kid and to be a kid within a safe environment for us, and have an opportunity to have their own bed, to have their own belongings to be a kid and to, have the same experience that many Australian other Australians have that take advantage of having their own room and beds.

So we wanna be able to create that. Safe space for many of our young people that we're working with because unfortunately at the moment [00:06:00] there's a lack of housing, which leads to a lack of sleep for our young people, which leads to a low attendance of school education. And then and then also quite often, our young people are breaking in and looking for food and being out on the streets because there is such an overcrowding house that they don't wanna be home.

I think we're unique as you Oonchiumpa because we are traditional owners.

We are respected and we do have the expertise, whether that's in education. We, Kylie worked in the education department whether that's in, employment governance and Centrelink and all of that. And also law, we wanna be able to have we wanna have a space where people are invited to come to us, to seek, what avenue, what part or what pathway do we, support this young person.

And because at the moment they're currently coming to us to seek that information. And [00:07:00] how do we as Oonchiumpa make sure that we're not, being used? And how do we Oonchiumpa create, our own revenue of businesses that are coming to us and government and organisations So I think basically Oonchiumpa to be, have a space where we invite people to be a part of our network, but then also.

Create revenue for them to consult with us, to, alright, I need a program for this young person and I need his identity, I need his connections. I need his role models. I need, and then you go and look, okay, what's he, what does his training and development look like? What does his education look like? But how is he this young person able to advocate for himself as well? 

Many of these kids, they come from big families. They come from big kinship, kinship relationships and kinship family groups as well. So we wanna be able to tap [00:08:00] into kinship families that we know that they're related to, but also start empowering the families to create a big family space and also bringing everyone along for the journey so that everyone.

Has a role to play because in a part of the kinship system, everyone does have a role to play. And even supporting, older siblings who are looking after younger siblings who unfortunately don't have parents. So we wanna be able to showcase this is how we can support, and as our big family, you're a part of our family and this is what, how we can try and support you in all of these, family aspects as well.

I think Oonchiumpa wants to be in a position to have an Oonchiumpa hub. So to rather than a lot of our, young people, a lot of our, middle aged, a lot of our teenagers, young adults, rather than them going to all of our services. One [00:09:00] hub for all, all nationalities because we know what Tang Jira can provide. We know what Congress can provide. We know what Naja can provi provide. We know what, training and developments.

There are, there's no one hub service. So we wanna be able to be as cultural authority groups holding one hub for. All service providers and all programs at the moment, Oonchiumpa provide a brokerage for all our Aboriginal businesses and so we're able to tap in and use all our Aboriginal businesses. We wanted to be able to have an Oonchiumpa hub to be able to.

Service all of our young people service all of our community members. If community members are coming in from, Mutujulu Doca river Literature country, we'll have somebody that can handle that community. Alright, so I need to access a PY Lands, I need to access NPY. So that's all in that region.

Okay, we can [00:10:00] connect you to the CEO there. We can connect you to workers there. If you've got, young people coming in from Yin moon. What does that look like in terms of connecting them with their, tanami training development stuff out there, Tanami, because Tanami is out on their country, how can we connect them with those dots?

And just being in a position to being able to navigate and connect people in the right services and the right programs. And we would definitely, that was our whole vision We wanted to have an Oonchiumpa hub. Sorry. Yeah, and because also, for the young people, we don't have an in-house playground.

That's what Kylie and Tanya is. We've got over all the mappings out already. Where's our playground, indoor playground. It's so hot here. But we wanna be able to create that. Like, where is that? So we wanna just have that space and for our young people to work and to [00:11:00] be proud of something that's theirs.

As a traditional owner in Banis, coming from two big pioneer families, the Bloomfield side, on my father's side and the Liddle side, we have many projects, many programs and and two businesses at the moment.

So first I'll start off with on. On Chomper, we've been able to secure funding with NIAA and that's helping our young people and providing them with an alternative service. And so we are we're lucky. We've been extended for two years, but that's only to provide. The basic stuff that we're providing now with HBC Henry Bloomfield contracting dad's out on the graders in community and looking for, an opportunity to expand.

Because a lot of the aboriginal men on communities, they wanna work with dad, they wanna work with an aboriginal man. Unfortunately, he doesn't have another grader. He doesn't have a camp. He doesn't have a roller, but [00:12:00] dad wants to be in a position to also train our young men to be able to have excavated license, a a bulldozer and Bobcat.

All of those little machinery operation, certificates he wants to be able to provide. We also have Loves Creek, which is on dad's country. So Loves Creek has been handed back to us as traditional owners, and so we have at Napa Homestead and Campground. It's such a unique space out there that we wanna be able to provide a tourism space out there for us, an opportunity to show our young people.

What our old people did in back in the days, a station hand work. We wanna be able to have a homestead there that they feel proud of, that they can go to the homestead. Back then they weren't, a aboriginal people weren't allowed in the homestead. So we wanna create that space as a homestead, as a museum, as a place for them, young fellas to learn.

From their old people, old [00:13:00] stockmen to be able to have that background with them. And we also have, the Flinders University research that we're working on now, and that'll give us a bit, an idea of all the work that we're doing with the young people. But I feel as though we're missing out on, the younger.

Adults missing out on leading them and empowering them to be able to, gain employment. Why can't they be trainees? Why can't they be tradesmen and stuff? So we wanna be able to create this space and, tradesmen, stockmen electricians and all of that to be able to, have their own programs on their own community.

And I think to do that, we definitely need funding to be able to secure, machinery infrastructure resources and support in terms of, renovating what we currently have to thrive in being able to build our, and empower our young people and aboriginal people in central [00:14:00] Australia.

As the chair of current chair of, I think. We wanna be able to bring back authority. Cultural authority for us is our under people on our land. And so in order to support Tupa, we wanna be able to, empower our traditional owners, and our state groups, and. And, start making people accountable, but also empowering them to be able to stand up and talk freely and to be in a position to challenge government and to be in a position to, take the lead on many of our opportunities and many of our programs and services as well.

We need funding to be able to sustain what we have, but also to grow it. Because at the moment we, we don't have any funding to grow what we already have. We're. Covering our bills at the moment and we wanna be able to support many of our Aboriginal people because a [00:15:00] lot do come to us, a family and a lot of also community members are looking for employment from us.

So we wanna be in a position to be funded, to be able to create these pathways for many of our community members.
