[00:00:00] Christie's organization on Tomba transforms these young lives, but their innovations remain invisible. That's why we've created Justice Hub to employ these same young people as paid professionals who document what actually works, not more programs, infrastructure that makes every program stronger.

Indigenous young people earn money, capturing community wisdom and learning from their own experiences. Simple technology helps organizations see these patterns of success. And then when Tenant Creek adapts spent, uh, Springs Innovations, when Darwin learns from Catherine as 20 organizations becoming twice as effective, that's thousands more lives people supported without building a single new program.

Every young people we employ saves taxpayers $1.1 million while generating about a hundred thousand dollars in [00:01:00] community value. Five apprentices in year one, 20 by year three. This isn't charity. It's the best investment Australia can make Jack one costs millions in detention. Or as a justice hub apprentice, he could transform how Australia supports young people.

Communities don't need saving. They need their solutions valued, documented, and funded.

Speaker 49: Dominated on 

Speaker 50: the 

Speaker 49: panel or whatever. Yeah. And then what happened when it came to the money part? Money story at CLC likes to call, um, they put it out to tender basically for people to. Be the lead agency. Yeah. Chris lead agency. Yep. And what happened? The backbone. The backbone agency. That's that 

Speaker 51: backbone.[00:02:00] 

Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And what happened is they gave it to, so you had to be, um, partnered with an aboriginal organization. Mm, yeah. And I remember being at that meeting when they were talking about the backbone. And as soon as like. So they said there's gonna be this much money backbone organization. You gotta be partnered with an aboriginal organization.

Well, as soon as the break happened, Anglicare, she was whipping around every table. White woman. Yeah. Wow. Trying to get AB Aboriginal organization on side with it so that they could go for it. 

Speaker 50: Shit. Because 

Speaker 49: she came over to us, she went everywhere and it really like put me off. I was like, no, this isn't. So then they did it and they gave it to Anglicare Care with, um, no Tipper and, um, desert Knowledge.

Desert Knowledge. The backbone. They were in the backbone Right. To [00:03:00] decide on kind of, yeah. Continue running this, but people got really quite fronted by Anglicare mm-hmm. Being involved because, I mean, A, they're a white organization. Mm-hmm. B they're a church based. You know, people just 

Speaker 50: mm-hmm. 

Speaker 49: Just didn't sit right with people.

Mm-hmm. But they did that, you know, like it, it's again that thing where like, mm-hmm oh, we've got something for the black community, but we're gonna make sure we get some white people 

Speaker 50: go overseas. 

Speaker 49: But I, who bent are there some white missionary back. 

Speaker 51: Yeah, I was talking to someone though that said they were running the Alice Justice reinvestment money.

They got supported. It was, um, she lives in Perth. Tracy Tracy per, 

Speaker 49: yeah. She's from Lu Perth. She's from Lu Perth. So what happened is that they lost pretty much everyone, everyone lost interest, quit the group. No one wanted anything to do a job. That's what I heard. Yeah. It was 

Speaker 51: all a fucking, so it all 

Speaker 49: fell apart and [00:04:00] now it's Lae.

Mm-hmm. They got rid of Anglicare. Yeah. And Desert Knowledge dropped out too, eh? Yeah. And what's Tracy want? And now's So Tracy's great, but um, so Tracy's the national, Hey, she's a part of the national Yeah. There's two body, so there's two different bodies. 

Speaker 51: Investment now I get it. So 

Speaker 49: Tracy's also, she's a part of the.

Justice reinvestment nationally. 

Speaker 51: This always confuses the fuck outta me because we, because it's justice reinvestment in a CT too. Right. And that's completely separate. We 

Speaker 49: had no idea about this until a couple of months. So Tracy came in and explained it to us. She trying to get people back back 

Speaker 51: because Strata's the national one.

Speaker 49: Okay. Oh 

Speaker 51: yes. So 

Speaker 49: what they won the national one? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Well, it's just the Central Australian. Central Australian back. But Tracy works for the national one. Yes. 

Speaker 51: See that's, that's why that justice, you wouldn't be involved with that justice reinvestment network. 'cause they, they're a national's peak body of, but see, no [00:05:00] one 

Speaker 49: understood that then.

And like we didn't, so everyone quit. No one wanted anything to do with it. Then Tracy's been going around trying to get people because back on the JR because, yeah, because I talked to months ago. She explain it to us and we were like, ah, you probably need to go tell people because everyone.

Speaker 52: Oh 

Speaker 51: yeah. Shit. 

Speaker 52: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: No wonder you can't get the funding. It's fucking so confusing. 

Speaker 52: It's a, yeah, it's all. Something that could be, and so does 

Speaker 51: the federal government top up the Central Australia justice reimbursement? They're 

Speaker 50: both funded by federal 

Speaker 51: weird. They're 

Speaker 50: both because there's 60, but they're two different bucket.

There's 

Speaker 51: 63 million in the national one. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And I think they've got 32 communities. And there's a really successful one that's Catherine, and that's seen as like one of the more successful ones in Australia and all the rest of them are shared. Wow. [00:06:00] And Burke, uh, Burke as well is not so bad, but 

Speaker 49: so why do they keep hammering it if it's not working?

Speaker 51: I just think that they want to be able to show a good news story from it, and they haven't been able to do that yet. And, 'cause I was at the opening, um, 

Speaker 52: Burke is the Juliana one. Juliana Demetrius. The Juliana Demetrius, that one that's, 

Speaker 51: yeah. Yeah, that, that's the one they talk about. And then. There's another one in Sydney they talk about a lot.

Um, just, just reinvest. Um, yeah. And they've, how was that too? And they've, they did a, a documentary with young kids, right? And that got quite a lot of support and interest, but the rest of them you never hear anything about. And I reached out to them and said, Hey, super interested in this. I wonder what happens if all of these people you support start supporting each other and learning from each other.

And they were like, good idea. We'll get back to you. Never. Um, and [00:07:00] so yeah, I think that's just like a really disconnected and what I'm hearing from you guys too, it's just like so confusing. It 

Speaker 52: is really confusing. Like, and especially 

Speaker 51: now with new government, they're like probably just like, what the fuck do we do now?

Yeah, 

Speaker 49: yeah. But it's something that could be positive. It's just oh hundred percent. They really like. 

Speaker 51: Especially if it's people 

Speaker 49: offside in 

Speaker 51: Alice. Especially if it's like you just say it's three years you can get, 

Speaker 49: yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 51: See three years is good, like way better than anything else. 

Speaker 49: But the amount of time they've mucked around by it will now actually be two years.

By the time you get 

Speaker 51: money, when when's the next submission? 

Speaker 49: We just, it submitted. Cool. It's the last chance. And when do you hear? Uh, I dunno. When we are here. 10. Yeah. Because the thing is too, then like they keep gaslighting us. Yeah, 

Speaker 50: totally. So 

Speaker 49: they begged us to apply for it. Yeah. Like NIAA ags, they're all like, please apply.

Please apply. Yeah. So we got Juliana, that consultant did our first [00:08:00] application. Sure. 

Speaker 51: And they had did Or 

Speaker 52: denied. Yeah. Denied. 

Speaker 49: So then they like, oh, we, you know, it didn't quite hit the mark, but we want you to apply again. Yeah. Please apply again. Like they us. 

Speaker 51: So they've got no one. And then they fucking, they gave it to, no 

Speaker 49: one gave it to, no one.

They gave the funding to, but then asked us to apply again. Again. So begrudgingly Christie and I did the next one ourselves. Yeah.

They feel focused with these people. Still gave it to, no one still gave it, and then be us to apply a third time. 

Speaker 51: What's the sort of questions? Is it like impact program principles for 

Speaker 49: Tanya's, but Juliana the first one we Mr. The Mark. You know, we didn't really do the basics. We did the basic specify the program.

Really? Yeah. Right. Yeah. And we got that. All right. But then Tanya and I did it. We like. What else do you want us to say? Say, because they gave us us, like all this feedback on what to do better next time. For sure. So we [00:09:00] did all the changes they told us. 

Speaker 51: Yep. 

Speaker 49: That, sorry. No, no one's getting it again. 

Speaker 51: Did they just, did they just email you and say shit or they ring you off or, no, they met with us in person.

Oh, gotcha. They 

Speaker 49: actually physically came to town, met with us in person. What a waste of money. Gu like, yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: That seems dumb too. It's just like, why do they travel all that way? Waste their own money, 

Speaker 49: but just give it to us. Yeah. Like is it okay asking us 

Speaker 51: to class 

Speaker 49: shit and let's, or give it to somebody so they can start it like far out.

So then they did this closed round. Yeah. That we just did again. Yeah. Do you know who 

Speaker 51: applied for it? 

Speaker 49: Yeah, those three. Yeah, us. 

Speaker 51: But you are Lu Tip. No, we on, but you are Lu Tip. Oh, yes, yes. 

Speaker 49: So Tracy applied, but yes, right. 

Speaker 51: Tracy. Okay. Tracy 

Speaker 49: applied through Lu 

Speaker 51: Tipper. But if Tracy gets it, you'll work with.

Partner with Tracy. 

Speaker 49: Fuck no. We don't wanna be associated with, 

Speaker 51: but you're the 

Speaker 52: chair. 

Speaker 49: No, I don't wanna be drama with, [00:10:00] Hey, we did, we built on Trumper selves. Sopa did ask us about partnering. A partnering. I was like, and, and I was gonna do it until they try to fucking sack me. And he is like, fuck. Mm-hmm. It's just ridiculous.

Speaker 51: Do you think if you do get it, could you roll some of that plan, like planning for St. Mary's into it or not? We don't 

Speaker 49: have enough money. Right. That wouldn't be enough. Basically, will we really apply for it to what we currently get? Yeah. And what we are currently doing. Hey, 10. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: How much do you reckon you need to ramp up something like that to Mary's stuff?

Would that be like a six mil thing or 

Speaker 49: It'd need a fair bit to fix it up.

Yeah, having said that, I mean 27 

Speaker 52: mil. 27 mil. 

Speaker 51: But yeah, that's the thing. It's, it's like a 'cause if, if it crosses over infrastructure, health and like youth, [00:11:00] you would think that you would be able to have a bit of a mixed like, um, mix of a building lease housing. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. True. Hey. 

Speaker 51: Mm. Fascinating. 

Speaker 50: Yes. That's, that's the background of Fuck, 

Speaker 51: I, yeah.

I, I'm so confused as to what states want to do with funding, especially just knowing that there's $230 million funding in Queensland to do something. Yeah, just like. 

Speaker 50: But I mean, like, it's, it's all, 

Speaker 51: it's all back rooms. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: It's, it's like very hard to understand what is actually there Yeah. What they're saying in the boardrooms.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And they, they might be just saying, oh, we know what we're giving it to. We'll just run it and then give it to that person. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. And even like for Alice, we're only small. Yeah. You can [00:12:00] see who's doing the work. You can see who's getting outcomes and providing data and doing all of that. Yeah. Why not continue that?

I know. Why the fuck do you Yeah, Ted like and create these barriers that are unnecessary. At the same time, NIAA goes around. Every chance they get talking about how great our service is. Yes. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And how like all these successes and like, yeah. But then behind closed doors, it's like, oh, but you know, we don't know if we'll let you continue.

You are winning the fight, but, 

Speaker 50: you know. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: So in reality, in like, in the sort of, um, the brutal reality is like you've got a runway till June. Mm. Yeah. Is that it? 

Speaker 50: Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: So yeah. So let's, yeah. AIM's got a runway away until September, so, yeah. [00:13:00] Um, and yet there's been no sort of philanthropic stuff, I guess.

Well, we 

Speaker 49: haven't really had the opportunity to cover that. Yeah. Which was one of the things we were gonna talk to you about because we've always wanted to do it. Yep. Um. 'cause a part of us, like we never wanted to be beholden to government. Yeah. 'cause everything comes with terms and conditions with government, you know?

Yeah. But we just are so busy trying to mm-hmm. Do what we are doing. Yeah. That we just haven't had the chance to. Mm, go into that space. Do you know Sandra Kramer? 

Speaker 51: No. Who's she? 

Speaker 49: Do you know Josh Kramer? 

Speaker 51: Josh I, I've heard of Josh Kramer. His 

Speaker 49: mom. His mom, right. She, she's like, um, very big. Like she used to run the Aboriginal Women's Alliance.

Yeah. She's part of the Faith Foundation. Yeah. She travels internationally. She's Queens fan. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: So she's always onto us about 

Speaker 51: the new topic coming. Well, I think it's [00:14:00] almost a scoping mechanism of like, um, Fairfax family and then Paul Ramsey of course. And then, um, like, I don't know where, um, like Twiggy Forest and his crew are, where that what they're thinking is at the moment.

But there's two foundations there now 'cause he got divorced. Right. 

Speaker 50: And so 

Speaker 51: he's got his and his wife's, um, almost like split it. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. So there's 

Speaker 51: a bit more like opportunity and especially if it's like a women led stuff. I think there's a bucket around that at the moment. And then there's random ones like Judith Nelson.

Right. And she's mass, like she does a he on, um, women coming out of, um, prison. Oh, okay. And so I'm sure she would be interested in young women. Yeah. Um, as well. But I think it's almost like. I don't know. This is, I never know where to where to sit with this stuff, but it's almost like how do you tell the case study what [00:15:00] you just said?

Yeah. And then go to philanthropy with the 'cause sometimes there's philanthropists that fucking hate government. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. And they 

Speaker 51: will support things in spite. Yeah, 

Speaker 50: yeah, yeah. Throw it in there and be 

Speaker 51: like, yeah. Proud in. Yeah. Um. But Paul Ramsey, um, started this consortium thing as well, which is place, which is government, bam, snow Foundation, like all of these people in one place.

Um, and then there's um, then there's really random people like the Dyson, um, starfish Star Fish benches make a bit of money, um, that. Quite possibly are about to back, um, Nick and I to do some discovery work around what, um, almost like best practices and use justice. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And that's the thing I was really interested to talk to you about is like, um, I think what's missing from an Australian [00:16:00] context is.

How do you write up how to work with young people and share that? Um, and then how do you almost create, um, like shared knowledge around this stuff? And I don't know, it just feels like you've got such broad history and act like connection to a number of things. There's land and then there's like. There's culture and kinship and then there's practice.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And even law, right? Like, um, yeah. So I'd love to just work out like over these four days maybe it's just like, what's that narrative that we start to, um, send to some philanthropy and just be like, here's what's going on. Yeah. Um, and then hopefully just get a few people to start coming out here like.

And I don't know what, like Snow Foundation are more health [00:17:00] focused Yeah. In terms of like, um, dramatic heart stuff. 

Speaker 50: Right. Okay. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: But they, they're in the same rooms, right? Yeah. Like they're in the same consortium of people with all of those other people. So, and it's horrible. Like, it's almost like dating, like you have to like 

Speaker 52: put 

Speaker 51: yourself out there and start dating these foundations and then.

Sometimes it's six months. And like Nick and I have been dating Snow Foundation for three years. Yeah, right. Wow. So I, so they supported Orange Sky. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And then I ran this, um, drug court, um, sort of discovery project in Canberra for a while. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And then we started doing the, the betting stuff. And then they said, this idea is too random.

We don't want to give you heaps of money, but. We'll give you some seed funding, like a little bit of money so you can just like see if it works or not. Yeah. So [00:18:00] they've done that twice now. And now Nick and I have got this trip with them, which is like, I don't know, what is it, eight hours in the car with the 

Speaker 49: tenant?

The founder? Yeah. Oh, that's the tenant. Yeah. So 

Speaker 51: that's the, that's the CEO that's coming with us. Right. Um, but yeah, like it's such a. Yeah, it's, that's one of those things too, where it's almost like you do a little sprint of like story and then you start putting it out there with people. Yeah. Um, and then June's a big month and I'd love just to keep sharing what's happening with Diagram as well.

Like if you can connect. 

Speaker 49: I read a lot about that. Like you talked about. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. If you can connect that global knowledge of what they've done for 20 years and almost be like pick the things that might [00:19:00] be useful. 

Speaker 52: Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Because I think the thing in which diagram is never gonna be able to do is pick up their model and put it somewhere.

But if someone like yourselves is like, there's parts of this that are actually very interesting that help us to. Like work in a traditional sense and have that connection, but then have some like frameworks Yeah. That you can use. Um, especially like they, they do really good stuff of leave of absence type things.

So young people that get to go back to community and have wraparound services. Um, and it's a hard context to, to bring to Australia, but. From when that young person goes to court from, to when they go back, all the services work together. So the magistrate, the court, the court, the, like the, the psychologist, the educator, the family, 

Speaker 49: yeah.

Speaker 51: They all [00:20:00] work as one 

Speaker 49: group. I mean, we pretty, we, yeah, we try to do that, isn't it? Like, you know, um, because if you 

Speaker 51: can prove that stuff out, that's a really, but I 

Speaker 49: think the problem we have is that there is a lack of. Services. That's right. And programs. There's just nowhere like, yeah. And I'm sure Anthony will say this.

Yeah, true. There's just nowhere for them to link adults or young people. Yeah. There's nothing 

Speaker 51: to link them to. And where, what do the courts do when they like, do they, um, 

Speaker 49: well, you could prefer sign 'em up to Europe, Satan. 

Speaker 51: Oh. What's your, what's Ys? 

Speaker 49: Ys is the youth average 

Speaker 51: Cool. Because 

Speaker 49: there's no behavior change.

Progress, right. There's no. There's not really. Yeah. 'cause he was saying there's not even any DV ones. 

Speaker 51: No. Why not? That's fucking, there's just nothing. But why, like Yeah. That's what confuses me. Why give all this money to put bandaids on the problem, which is required, but then not try to quote, but Yeah. 

Speaker 49: You know like the liberal 

Speaker 51: party 

Speaker 49: [00:21:00] that just came in, they won their entire election on their 

Speaker 51: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 49: Nothing that's actually true. Holistic. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: Long term. Solution. 

Speaker 51: And when do you hear about the bootcamp thing? 

Speaker 49: I don't know. Like we've lodged it through. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: How much is that? 

Speaker 49: I don't even know. Oh, yeah, we just kind of put in the application. Right. Pretty much just lodged, put our name down there. True.

Like an express of 

Speaker 51: interest, right? Yeah. 

Speaker 49: Yeah, that's right. And so until they reach out to us, what that looks like, I just 

Speaker 51: can't see you ladies running a bootcamp in your vertical. No ology, but it's not, you see, you see how the little shits come up to us. I know. They, you don't, you, you don't get cuddles at a boot camp.

No. Ted pushups. Yeah, 

Speaker 52: yeah, 

Speaker 51: yeah, yeah. Running around. 

Speaker 52: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And even, you know, when they were Johnny's that time, they were like, um. Hey, we're that old man and we was teasing him, you know, Hey, your grandsons were asking [00:22:00] you, Hey, you bloody pastor. 

Speaker 51: So it wouldn't be that hard to almost do like a, um, a review of services in Alice Springs, right.

Like you could do, write them down and they'll be 

Speaker 49: Yeah, I think they're already, they're doing that. 

Speaker 51: Oh, they're doing it. Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And we do have a couple of research 

Speaker 51: Yes. 

Speaker 49: Papers, Hey Tan, that they've done around it. Oh, 

Speaker 51: so just of scope of how many services? Oh yeah. 

Speaker 49: They'll send you that stuff if you're interested then.

Speaker 51: Yeah. So we can, yeah, I just, I just did one in Queensland, um, and it was super hard. Yeah, yeah. But Alice should be a simpler, they've 

Speaker 49: got like a whole used, what do they call that document? Uh, what was that? Yeah, we'll send you it all. Cool. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: That's rad. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. I, I'm, but 

Speaker 49: still nothing. Hey, Tanya came out of that.

No, they've done, we've got two reports. They did all they're reports, but yeah, like, and then we're still in a position that will be [00:23:00] r in. You know, I just, I 

Speaker 51: honestly, and you are in the reports? No, we're not. Gotcha. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. Honestly think they just don't, don't know what to do. I think the problem has become so large 

Speaker 50: that 

Speaker 49: they're just at a loss.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: I mean, we know the. That Aboriginal take people take the lead. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. I just don't think they know how to fix it. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. Even just like, sometimes you don't even need that much resource too, to test something for it least to you. Um, in comparison to all of the other government programs, especially when you hear that, that like 80 mil to build a gallery that no one wants.

Like, that's fascinating, right? Yeah.

Speaker 52: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 51: Yeah, and sometimes it's, um[00:24:00] 

hmm. Sometimes government doesn't know what to do with people like yourselves too. I think because you have such broad knowledge across all of these areas. Yeah. Sometimes they just want someone to come to them and say. We're gonna run this program for three years and it's gonna do, it's gonna help. And then they're like, oh, fuck yeah.

It's almost like, what can they write in their media release? Um, 

Speaker 52: yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Which is so shit.

And do you, did you have the Prime Minister up here? 

Speaker 49: Yeah, we here a couple of. Yeah, he came jacin 

Speaker 51: and came. Did he get, did he get around and talk to anyone or was it more just like, got in front of the camera? Neither 

Speaker 49: got in front of the me. The group went to Laura Timber and met with traditional owners.

Yeah. Shit. And they came, they fly in and fly out in one day, shit. Yeah. And they, they choose some random businesses to go [00:25:00] hang out at. They both do it and then they fly out again. 

Speaker 50: Oh. That 

Speaker 51: the 

Speaker 49: trip to Alice. 

Speaker 51: Fuck so bad.

Mm. So I'll say, I was saying, um, before there's Yeah, there's Churchill Fellowship coming up. Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. I'd love to help you guys apply for it. I remember that 

Speaker 50: when I was 

Speaker 51: at uni. Yeah. Yeah. There's, I reckon, yeah, I reckon you a hundred percent get it. And there's a couple of options. Um, you can do a, so this is where, 

Speaker 49: sorry, this is where our start.

Speaker 51: Cool. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Oh, awesome.

So you can do a, you can do a joint one, so you too could apply. You could do one where you can like, um, [00:26:00] ask anyone to go with you. So you could ask me to come and we could go and do that documentary about the whole thing. Yeah. 

Speaker 50: Cool. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And then you could do, um, one on your own and I think you just have to try.

And what I would do is just review the last few years to see what they've supported, and then I've got a few people who could be references that are already in the Churchill. Um, group. So they have this like fellowship group that are people that have been there in the past. Mm-hmm. There's a really awesome friend of mine who did hers in Spain and Germany and the US on youth justice centers.

Wow. Yeah. And she could like help, um, just be like a reference and a, a sense check. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Um, so you could, but yeah, but I, I guess you have to focus on one thing, so it, it either be. Like you justice models or to be like land ownership or whatever, and I'm not sure if you, and you might even be able to apply for a couple like [00:27:00] different ones.

Yeah. Right. Um, the, and the best thing that happens from it is then you are a Churchill fellow, which is just like this thing, you can put any anywhere but like, like based a Churchill fellow and then you can even apply to be, um, to get, um, an alumni. 

Speaker 50: Yeah, 

Speaker 51: and then you, then they give you money to do additional.

So Kate is getting money at the moment to do additional research in use Justice in Queensland. So, um, yeah, it's a really good one. And then, oh, there is no, I dunno if you want to do this, I had a really bad experience just, just to like, put it out there. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: But a and p has something at the moment and it's a OP tomorrow maker.

Okay, 

Speaker 50: I think I've heard of that. 

Speaker 51: Yeah, it's due pretty soon. And I could put one in for you if you're keen. Um, and Nick and I did it together so you could do it together. So it's $20,000, which is just untied money, but for six months it's once a week. You do these [00:28:00] Zoom calls on like, um, social impact. And then there's one, um, intensive where you go away for two days and you come together as a group and you always talk about like what you wanna build.

And then there's like a event at the end where you can, um, go for another 20 grand. And that's what Brody won last year, right? He won the 20 people's choice, they call it. 

Speaker 50: Yep. 

Speaker 51: But then what happens is if you, if you successfully go through that, then the following year you can apply as, um, a spark, um, fellow, and then you can, that's $120,000 for one year.

Wow. 

Speaker 50: And 

Speaker 51: that's just, that's just money you can spend on anything. Yeah. True. Um, but it, like, it's a horrible fucking thing. 'cause it's, it's very, it's very like, um, it's pretty much just a and p trying to find some diverse people where they can say we've supported them. 

Speaker 50: Yep. 

Speaker 51: Um, [00:29:00] but you also get some money and you get some, like, you get to be.

Call it tomorrow Maker. Um, but um, yeah, so Brody had that last year. Yeah. And he, he had a, I think he had a pretty good experience. Like you do get the, the best thing is you get to meet some rad people. Yeah, yeah. Like there's some cool people who are doing social enterprise stuff that we still hang out with now.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Um, that's cool. Um, and then there's the Maya one, which Nick got to the top six and then didn't get it. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Right. So he was. It was blowing. Um, so that's 140 grand and it's just 

Speaker 50: that one then? Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Sydney Mayer Fellowship. So that's like my other shop there. Um, the foundation, and that's every year, but only three people get that.

Um, but it's like a it, and it can be whatever you want, like it could be for the organization or whatever. Um, and then the Snow Foundation used to have ones, but they [00:30:00] stopped. Theirs was really good. There was 200 grand just to put into your business. Yeah, right. And support. Um, but yeah, and it's, it is the type of thing where you pretty much just keep going for it.

And then the other one is the Westpac one, which is more, uh, um, like you get 50 grand and then you travel around to support your brand as a social entrepreneur. Um, but Westpac's pretty good with that. Like Joe Qua got that and he got that. And, um. And have you heard of, um, Corey Tutt and Deadly Science? 

Speaker 50: No.

Speaker 51: So he's, he's free Rad too. He writes books on, um, first Nations Science. Oh, 

Speaker 50: okay. And 

Speaker 51: then he just, uh, he got the Westpac thing as well, but he's really good. He's got a very big ego. But, um, yeah, super nice follow. But yeah, these are the things you just like, um, almost just start going for, and like. They're [00:31:00] good for just being in those networks and understanding that stuff and 

Speaker 49: Yeah.

Speaker 51: Because you, you've never been like social enterprise type model. 

Speaker 49: No, we haven't. We, we wanna, that's another thing that's been on our to do list every year is to someone, 'cause it's been suggested to us, like if you have a social enterprise arm mm-hmm. Slash a charitable arm, it makes it, you're available to other funding opportunities.

Yeah. 

Speaker 51: DGR and stuff. Yeah. 

Speaker 49: But we just, again, haven't had time to sit down online 

Speaker 51: properly. 

Speaker 49: Cool. How to do it. What to do, yeah. That kind of stuff. Right. Ben was talking about, um, ORIC Tank too. Yeah. And Brody and man E's only the board member for, or Oh, for his own corporation. You get, you'd get exemption.

Yeah. So, I don't know. I'm, 

Speaker 51: I'm actually trying to do it for Sean, so we could do it as well for you guys. 

Speaker 49: So that's why I'm [00:32:00] thinking well, we, yeah, maybe we can then, I don't know. I, 

Speaker 51: I reckon especially 'cause if it's two of you Yeah, I reckon a hundred percent because I 

Speaker 49: could do that tap because 

Speaker 51: you don't need be one off then.

And then that'd be, that'd be right. And even if they come and say three.

Speaker 49: Dominated on 

Speaker 50: the 

Speaker 49: panel or whatever. Yeah. And then what happened when it came to the money part? Money story at CLC likes to call, um, they put it out to tender basically for people to. Be the lead agency. Yeah. Chris lead agency. Yep. And what happened? The backbone. The backbone agency. That's that 

Speaker 51: backbone.

Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And what happened is they gave it to, so you had to be, um, partnered with an aboriginal organization. Mm, yeah. And I remember being at that meeting when they were talking about the [00:33:00] backbone. And as soon as like. So they said there's gonna be this much money backbone organization. You gotta be partnered with an aboriginal organization.

Well, as soon as the break happened, Anglicare, she was whipping around every table. White woman. Yeah. Wow. Trying to get AB Aboriginal organization on side with it so that they could go for it. 

Speaker 50: Shit. Because 

Speaker 49: she came over to us, she went everywhere and it really like put me off. I was like, no, this isn't. So then they did it and they gave it to Anglicare Care with, um, no Tipper and, um, desert Knowledge.

Desert Knowledge. The backbone. They were in the backbone Right. To decide on kind of, yeah. Continue running this, but people got really quite fronted by Anglicare mm-hmm. Being involved because, I mean, A, they're a white organization. Mm-hmm. [00:34:00] B they're a church based. You know, people just 

Speaker 50: mm-hmm. 

Speaker 49: Just didn't sit right with people.

Mm-hmm. But they did that, you know, like it, it's again that thing where like, mm-hmm oh, we've got something for the black community, but we're gonna make sure we get some white people 

Speaker 50: go overseas. 

Speaker 49: But I, who bent are there some white missionary back. 

Speaker 51: Yeah, I was talking to someone though that said they were running the Alice Justice reinvestment money.

They got supported. It was, um, she lives in Perth. Tracy Tracy per, 

Speaker 49: yeah. She's from Lu Perth. She's from Lu Perth. So what happened is that they lost pretty much everyone, everyone lost interest, quit the group. No one wanted anything to do a job. That's what I heard. Yeah. It was 

Speaker 51: all a fucking, so it all 

Speaker 49: fell apart and now it's Lae.

Mm-hmm. They got rid of Anglicare. Yeah. And Desert Knowledge dropped out too, eh? Yeah. And what's Tracy want? And now's So Tracy's great, but um, so Tracy's the national, Hey, she's a part of [00:35:00] the national Yeah. There's two body, so there's two different bodies. 

Speaker 51: Investment now I get it. So 

Speaker 49: Tracy's also, she's a part of the.

Justice reinvestment nationally. 

Speaker 51: This always confuses the fuck outta me because we, because it's justice reinvestment in a CT too. Right. And that's completely separate. We 

Speaker 49: had no idea about this until a couple of months. So Tracy came in and explained it to us. She trying to get people back back 

Speaker 51: because Strata's the national one.

Speaker 49: Okay. Oh 

Speaker 51: yes. So 

Speaker 49: what they won the national one? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Well, it's just the Central Australian. Central Australian back. But Tracy works for the national one. Yes. 

Speaker 51: See that's, that's why that justice, you wouldn't be involved with that justice reinvestment network. 'cause they, they're a national's peak body of, but see, no one 

Speaker 49: understood that then.

And like we didn't, so everyone quit. No one wanted anything to do with it. Then Tracy's been going around trying to get people because back on the JR because, yeah, because I talked to months ago. She explain it to us and we were like, ah, you [00:36:00] probably need to go tell people because everyone.

Speaker 52: Oh 

Speaker 51: yeah. Shit. 

Speaker 52: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: No wonder you can't get the funding. It's fucking so confusing. 

Speaker 52: It's a, yeah, it's all. Something that could be, and so does 

Speaker 51: the federal government top up the Central Australia justice reimbursement? They're 

Speaker 50: both funded by federal 

Speaker 51: weird. They're 

Speaker 50: both because there's 60, but they're two different bucket.

There's 

Speaker 51: 63 million in the national one. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And I think they've got 32 communities. And there's a really successful one that's Catherine, and that's seen as like one of the more successful ones in Australia and all the rest of them are shared. Wow. And Burke, uh, Burke as well is not so bad, but 

Speaker 49: so why do they keep hammering it if it's not working?

Speaker 51: I just think that they want to be able to show a good news story from it, and they haven't [00:37:00] been able to do that yet. And, 'cause I was at the opening, um, 

Speaker 52: Burke is the Juliana one. Juliana Demetrius. The Juliana Demetrius, that one that's, 

Speaker 51: yeah. Yeah, that, that's the one they talk about. And then. There's another one in Sydney they talk about a lot.

Um, just, just reinvest. Um, yeah. And they've, how was that too? And they've, they did a, a documentary with young kids, right? And that got quite a lot of support and interest, but the rest of them you never hear anything about. And I reached out to them and said, Hey, super interested in this. I wonder what happens if all of these people you support start supporting each other and learning from each other.

And they were like, good idea. We'll get back to you. Never. Um, and so yeah, I think that's just like a really disconnected and what I'm hearing from you guys too, it's just like so confusing. It 

Speaker 52: is really confusing. Like, and especially 

Speaker 51: now with new government, they're like probably just like, what the fuck do we do now?

Yeah, 

Speaker 49: yeah. [00:38:00] But it's something that could be positive. It's just oh hundred percent. They really like. 

Speaker 51: Especially if it's people 

Speaker 49: offside in 

Speaker 51: Alice. Especially if it's like you just say it's three years you can get, 

Speaker 49: yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 51: See three years is good, like way better than anything else. 

Speaker 49: But the amount of time they've mucked around by it will now actually be two years.

By the time you get 

Speaker 51: money, when when's the next submission? 

Speaker 49: We just, it submitted. Cool. It's the last chance. And when do you hear? Uh, I dunno. When we are here. 10. Yeah. Because the thing is too, then like they keep gaslighting us. Yeah, 

Speaker 50: totally. So 

Speaker 49: they begged us to apply for it. Yeah. Like NIAA ags, they're all like, please apply.

Please apply. Yeah. So we got Juliana, that consultant did our first application. Sure. 

Speaker 51: And they had did Or 

Speaker 52: denied. Yeah. Denied. 

Speaker 49: So then they like, oh, we, you know, it didn't quite hit the mark, but we want you to apply again. Yeah. Please apply again. Like they us. 

Speaker 51: So they've got no one. [00:39:00] And then they fucking, they gave it to, no 

Speaker 49: one gave it to, no one.

They gave the funding to, but then asked us to apply again. Again. So begrudgingly Christie and I did the next one ourselves. Yeah.

They feel focused with these people. Still gave it to, no one still gave it, and then be us to apply a third time. 

Speaker 51: What's the sort of questions? Is it like impact program principles for 

Speaker 49: Tanya's, but Juliana the first one we Mr. The Mark. You know, we didn't really do the basics. We did the basic specify the program.

Really? Yeah. Right. Yeah. And we got that. All right. But then Tanya and I did it. We like. What else do you want us to say? Say, because they gave us us, like all this feedback on what to do better next time. For sure. So we did all the changes they told us. 

Speaker 51: Yep. 

Speaker 49: That, sorry. No, no one's getting it again. 

Speaker 51: Did they just, did they just email you and say shit or they ring you off or, no, they met with us in person.

Oh, gotcha. They 

Speaker 49: actually physically came to town, met with us in person. What a waste of money. [00:40:00] Gu like, yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: That seems dumb too. It's just like, why do they travel all that way? Waste their own money, 

Speaker 49: but just give it to us. Yeah. Like is it okay asking us 

Speaker 51: to class 

Speaker 49: shit and let's, or give it to somebody so they can start it like far out.

So then they did this closed round. Yeah. That we just did again. Yeah. Do you know who 

Speaker 51: applied for it? 

Speaker 49: Yeah, those three. Yeah, us. 

Speaker 51: But you are Lu Tip. No, we on, but you are Lu Tip. Oh, yes, yes. 

Speaker 49: So Tracy applied, but yes, right. 

Speaker 51: Tracy. Okay. Tracy 

Speaker 49: applied through Lu 

Speaker 51: Tipper. But if Tracy gets it, you'll work with.

Partner with Tracy. 

Speaker 49: Fuck no. We don't wanna be associated with, 

Speaker 51: but you're the 

Speaker 52: chair. 

Speaker 49: No, I don't wanna be drama with, Hey, we did, we built on Trumper selves. Sopa did ask us about partnering. A partnering. I was like, and, and I was gonna do it until they try to fucking sack me. And he is like, fuck. [00:41:00] Mm-hmm. It's just ridiculous.

Speaker 51: Do you think if you do get it, could you roll some of that plan, like planning for St. Mary's into it or not? We don't 

Speaker 49: have enough money. Right. That wouldn't be enough. Basically, will we really apply for it to what we currently get? Yeah. And what we are currently doing. Hey, 10. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: How much do you reckon you need to ramp up something like that to Mary's stuff?

Would that be like a six mil thing or 

Speaker 49: It'd need a fair bit to fix it up.

Yeah, having said that, I mean 27 

Speaker 52: mil. 27 mil. 

Speaker 51: But yeah, that's the thing. It's, it's like a 'cause if, if it crosses over infrastructure, health and like youth, you would think that you would be able to have a bit of a mixed like, um, mix of a building lease housing. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. True. Hey. 

Speaker 51: Mm. [00:42:00] Fascinating. 

Speaker 50: Yes. That's, that's the background of Fuck, 

Speaker 51: I, yeah.

I, I'm so confused as to what states want to do with funding, especially just knowing that there's $230 million funding in Queensland to do something. Yeah, just like. 

Speaker 50: But I mean, like, it's, it's all, 

Speaker 51: it's all back rooms. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: It's, it's like very hard to understand what is actually there Yeah. What they're saying in the boardrooms.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And they, they might be just saying, oh, we know what we're giving it to. We'll just run it and then give it to that person. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. And even like for Alice, we're only small. Yeah. You can see who's doing the work. You can see who's getting outcomes and providing data and doing all of that. Yeah. Why not continue that?

I know. Why the fuck do you Yeah, Ted like and [00:43:00] create these barriers that are unnecessary. At the same time, NIAA goes around. Every chance they get talking about how great our service is. Yes. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And how like all these successes and like, yeah. But then behind closed doors, it's like, oh, but you know, we don't know if we'll let you continue.

You are winning the fight, but, 

Speaker 50: you know. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: So in reality, in like, in the sort of, um, the brutal reality is like you've got a runway till June. Mm. Yeah. Is that it? 

Speaker 50: Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: So yeah. So let's, yeah. AIM's got a runway away until September, so, yeah. Um, and yet there's been no sort of philanthropic stuff, I guess.

Well, we 

Speaker 49: haven't really had the opportunity to cover that. Yeah. Which was one of the things we were gonna talk to you about because we've always wanted to do it. [00:44:00] Yep. Um. 'cause a part of us, like we never wanted to be beholden to government. Yeah. 'cause everything comes with terms and conditions with government, you know?

Yeah. But we just are so busy trying to mm-hmm. Do what we are doing. Yeah. That we just haven't had the chance to. Mm, go into that space. Do you know Sandra Kramer? 

Speaker 51: No. Who's she? 

Speaker 49: Do you know Josh Kramer? 

Speaker 51: Josh I, I've heard of Josh Kramer. His 

Speaker 49: mom. His mom, right. She, she's like, um, very big. Like she used to run the Aboriginal Women's Alliance.

Yeah. She's part of the Faith Foundation. Yeah. She travels internationally. She's Queens fan. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: So she's always onto us about 

Speaker 51: the new topic coming. Well, I think it's almost a scoping mechanism of like, um, Fairfax family and then Paul Ramsey of course. And then, um, like, I don't know where, [00:45:00] um, like Twiggy Forest and his crew are, where that what they're thinking is at the moment.

But there's two foundations there now 'cause he got divorced. Right. 

Speaker 50: And so 

Speaker 51: he's got his and his wife's, um, almost like split it. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. So there's 

Speaker 51: a bit more like opportunity and especially if it's like a women led stuff. I think there's a bucket around that at the moment. And then there's random ones like Judith Nelson.

Right. And she's mass, like she does a he on, um, women coming out of, um, prison. Oh, okay. And so I'm sure she would be interested in young women. Yeah. Um, as well. But I think it's almost like. I don't know. This is, I never know where to where to sit with this stuff, but it's almost like how do you tell the case study what you just said?

Yeah. And then go to philanthropy with the 'cause sometimes there's philanthropists that fucking hate government. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. And they 

Speaker 51: will support things in spite. Yeah, 

Speaker 50: yeah, yeah. Throw it in there and be 

Speaker 51: like, yeah. Proud in. Yeah. Um. But [00:46:00] Paul Ramsey, um, started this consortium thing as well, which is place, which is government, bam, snow Foundation, like all of these people in one place.

Um, and then there's um, then there's really random people like the Dyson, um, starfish Star Fish benches make a bit of money, um, that. Quite possibly are about to back, um, Nick and I to do some discovery work around what, um, almost like best practices and use justice. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And that's the thing I was really interested to talk to you about is like, um, I think what's missing from an Australian context is.

How do you write up how to work with young people and share that? Um, and then how do you almost create, um, like [00:47:00] shared knowledge around this stuff? And I don't know, it just feels like you've got such broad history and act like connection to a number of things. There's land and then there's like. There's culture and kinship and then there's practice.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And even law, right? Like, um, yeah. So I'd love to just work out like over these four days maybe it's just like, what's that narrative that we start to, um, send to some philanthropy and just be like, here's what's going on. Yeah. Um, and then hopefully just get a few people to start coming out here like.

And I don't know what, like Snow Foundation are more health focused Yeah. In terms of like, um, dramatic heart stuff. 

Speaker 50: Right. Okay. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: But they, they're in the same rooms, right? Yeah. Like they're in the same consortium of [00:48:00] people with all of those other people. So, and it's horrible. Like, it's almost like dating, like you have to like 

Speaker 52: put 

Speaker 51: yourself out there and start dating these foundations and then.

Sometimes it's six months. And like Nick and I have been dating Snow Foundation for three years. Yeah, right. Wow. So I, so they supported Orange Sky. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And then I ran this, um, drug court, um, sort of discovery project in Canberra for a while. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And then we started doing the, the betting stuff. And then they said, this idea is too random.

We don't want to give you heaps of money, but. We'll give you some seed funding, like a little bit of money so you can just like see if it works or not. Yeah. So they've done that twice now. And now Nick and I have got this trip with them, which is like, I don't know, what is it, eight hours in the car with the 

Speaker 49: tenant?

The founder? Yeah. Oh, that's the tenant. Yeah. So 

Speaker 51: that's the, that's the CEO that's coming [00:49:00] with us. Right. Um, but yeah, like it's such a. Yeah, it's, that's one of those things too, where it's almost like you do a little sprint of like story and then you start putting it out there with people. Yeah. Um, and then June's a big month and I'd love just to keep sharing what's happening with Diagram as well.

Like if you can connect. 

Speaker 49: I read a lot about that. Like you talked about. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. If you can connect that global knowledge of what they've done for 20 years and almost be like pick the things that might be useful. 

Speaker 52: Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Because I think the thing in which diagram is never gonna be able to do is pick up their model and put it somewhere.

But if someone like yourselves is like, there's parts of this that are actually very [00:50:00] interesting that help us to. Like work in a traditional sense and have that connection, but then have some like frameworks Yeah. That you can use. Um, especially like they, they do really good stuff of leave of absence type things.

So young people that get to go back to community and have wraparound services. Um, and it's a hard context to, to bring to Australia, but. From when that young person goes to court from, to when they go back, all the services work together. So the magistrate, the court, the court, the, like the, the psychologist, the educator, the family, 

Speaker 49: yeah.

Speaker 51: They all work as one 

Speaker 49: group. I mean, we pretty, we, yeah, we try to do that, isn't it? Like, you know, um, because if you 

Speaker 51: can prove that stuff out, that's a really, but I 

Speaker 49: think the problem we have is that there is a lack of. Services. That's right. And [00:51:00] programs. There's just nowhere like, yeah. And I'm sure Anthony will say this.

Yeah, true. There's just nowhere for them to link adults or young people. Yeah. There's nothing 

Speaker 51: to link them to. And where, what do the courts do when they like, do they, um, 

Speaker 49: well, you could prefer sign 'em up to Europe, Satan. 

Speaker 51: Oh. What's your, what's Ys? 

Speaker 49: Ys is the youth average 

Speaker 51: Cool. Because 

Speaker 49: there's no behavior change.

Progress, right. There's no. There's not really. Yeah. 'cause he was saying there's not even any DV ones. 

Speaker 51: No. Why not? That's fucking, there's just nothing. But why, like Yeah. That's what confuses me. Why give all this money to put bandaids on the problem, which is required, but then not try to quote, but Yeah. 

Speaker 49: You know like the liberal 

Speaker 51: party 

Speaker 49: that just came in, they won their entire election on their 

Speaker 51: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 49: Nothing that's actually true. Holistic. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: Long term. Solution. 

Speaker 51: And when do you hear about the bootcamp thing? 

Speaker 49: I don't know. Like we've [00:52:00] lodged it through. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: How much is that? 

Speaker 49: I don't even know. Oh, yeah, we just kind of put in the application. Right. Pretty much just lodged, put our name down there. True.

Like an express of 

Speaker 51: interest, right? Yeah. 

Speaker 49: Yeah, that's right. And so until they reach out to us, what that looks like, I just 

Speaker 51: can't see you ladies running a bootcamp in your vertical. No ology, but it's not, you see, you see how the little shits come up to us. I know. They, you don't, you, you don't get cuddles at a boot camp.

No. Ted pushups. Yeah, 

Speaker 52: yeah, 

Speaker 51: yeah, yeah. Running around. 

Speaker 52: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And even, you know, when they were Johnny's that time, they were like, um. Hey, we're that old man and we was teasing him, you know, Hey, your grandsons were asking you, Hey, you bloody pastor. 

Speaker 51: So it wouldn't be that hard to almost do like a, um, a review of services in Alice Springs, right.

Like you could do, write them down and they'll be 

Speaker 49: Yeah, [00:53:00] I think they're already, they're doing that. 

Speaker 51: Oh, they're doing it. Yeah. 

Speaker 49: And we do have a couple of research 

Speaker 51: Yes. 

Speaker 49: Papers, Hey Tan, that they've done around it. Oh, 

Speaker 51: so just of scope of how many services? Oh yeah. 

Speaker 49: They'll send you that stuff if you're interested then.

Speaker 51: Yeah. So we can, yeah, I just, I just did one in Queensland, um, and it was super hard. Yeah, yeah. But Alice should be a simpler, they've 

Speaker 49: got like a whole used, what do they call that document? Uh, what was that? Yeah, we'll send you it all. Cool. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: That's rad. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. I, I'm, but 

Speaker 49: still nothing. Hey, Tanya came out of that.

No, they've done, we've got two reports. They did all they're reports, but yeah, like, and then we're still in a position that will be r in. You know, I just, I 

Speaker 51: honestly, and you are in the reports? No, we're not. Gotcha. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. Honestly think they just don't, don't know what to do. I think the problem has become so large 

Speaker 50: that 

Speaker 49: they're just at [00:54:00] a loss.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: I mean, we know the. That Aboriginal take people take the lead. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. I just don't think they know how to fix it. 

Speaker 51: Yeah. Even just like, sometimes you don't even need that much resource too, to test something for it least to you. Um, in comparison to all of the other government programs, especially when you hear that, that like 80 mil to build a gallery that no one wants.

Like, that's fascinating, right? Yeah.

Speaker 52: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 51: Yeah, and sometimes it's, um

hmm. Sometimes government doesn't know what to do with people like yourselves too. I think because you have such broad knowledge across all of these areas. Yeah. Sometimes they [00:55:00] just want someone to come to them and say. We're gonna run this program for three years and it's gonna do, it's gonna help. And then they're like, oh, fuck yeah.

It's almost like, what can they write in their media release? Um, 

Speaker 52: yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Which is so shit.

And do you, did you have the Prime Minister up here? 

Speaker 49: Yeah, we here a couple of. Yeah, he came jacin 

Speaker 51: and came. Did he get, did he get around and talk to anyone or was it more just like, got in front of the camera? Neither 

Speaker 49: got in front of the me. The group went to Laura Timber and met with traditional owners.

Yeah. Shit. And they came, they fly in and fly out in one day, shit. Yeah. And they, they choose some random businesses to go hang out at. They both do it and then they fly out again. 

Speaker 50: Oh. That 

Speaker 51: the 

Speaker 49: trip to Alice. 

Speaker 51: Fuck so bad.[00:56:00] 

Mm. So I'll say, I was saying, um, before there's Yeah, there's Churchill Fellowship coming up. Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. I'd love to help you guys apply for it. I remember that 

Speaker 50: when I was 

Speaker 51: at uni. Yeah. Yeah. There's, I reckon, yeah, I reckon you a hundred percent get it. And there's a couple of options. Um, you can do a, so this is where, 

Speaker 49: sorry, this is where our start.

Speaker 51: Cool. 

Speaker 49: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Oh, awesome.

So you can do a, you can do a joint one, so you too could apply. You could do one where you can like, um, ask anyone to go with you. So you could ask me to come and we could go and do that documentary about the whole thing. Yeah. 

Speaker 50: Cool. Yeah. 

Speaker 51: And then you could do, um, one on your own and I think you just have to try.

And what I would do [00:57:00] is just review the last few years to see what they've supported, and then I've got a few people who could be references that are already in the Churchill. Um, group. So they have this like fellowship group that are people that have been there in the past. Mm-hmm. There's a really awesome friend of mine who did hers in Spain and Germany and the US on youth justice centers.

Wow. Yeah. And she could like help, um, just be like a reference and a, a sense check. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Um, so you could, but yeah, but I, I guess you have to focus on one thing, so it, it either be. Like you justice models or to be like land ownership or whatever, and I'm not sure if you, and you might even be able to apply for a couple like different ones.

Yeah. Right. Um, the, and the best thing that happens from it is then you are a Churchill fellow, which is just like this thing, you can put any anywhere but like, like based a Churchill fellow and then you can even apply to be, [00:58:00] um, to get, um, an alumni. 

Speaker 50: Yeah, 

Speaker 51: and then you, then they give you money to do additional.

So Kate is getting money at the moment to do additional research in use Justice in Queensland. So, um, yeah, it's a really good one. And then, oh, there is no, I dunno if you want to do this, I had a really bad experience just, just to like, put it out there. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: But a and p has something at the moment and it's a OP tomorrow maker.

Okay, 

Speaker 50: I think I've heard of that. 

Speaker 51: Yeah, it's due pretty soon. And I could put one in for you if you're keen. Um, and Nick and I did it together so you could do it together. So it's $20,000, which is just untied money, but for six months it's once a week. You do these Zoom calls on like, um, social impact. And then there's one, um, intensive where you go away for two days and you come together as a group and you always talk about like what you wanna build.

And [00:59:00] then there's like a event at the end where you can, um, go for another 20 grand. And that's what Brody won last year, right? He won the 20 people's choice, they call it. 

Speaker 50: Yep. 

Speaker 51: But then what happens is if you, if you successfully go through that, then the following year you can apply as, um, a spark, um, fellow, and then you can, that's $120,000 for one year.

Wow. 

Speaker 50: And 

Speaker 51: that's just, that's just money you can spend on anything. Yeah. True. Um, but it, like, it's a horrible fucking thing. 'cause it's, it's very, it's very like, um, it's pretty much just a and p trying to find some diverse people where they can say we've supported them. 

Speaker 50: Yep. 

Speaker 51: Um, but you also get some money and you get some, like, you get to be.

Call it tomorrow Maker. Um, but um, yeah, so Brody had that last year. Yeah. And he, he had a, I think he had a pretty good experience. [01:00:00] Like you do get the, the best thing is you get to meet some rad people. Yeah, yeah. Like there's some cool people who are doing social enterprise stuff that we still hang out with now.

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Um, that's cool. Um, and then there's the Maya one, which Nick got to the top six and then didn't get it. 

Speaker 50: Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Right. So he was. It was blowing. Um, so that's 140 grand and it's just 

Speaker 50: that one then? Yeah. 

Speaker 51: Sydney Mayer Fellowship. So that's like my other shop there. Um, the foundation, and that's every year, but only three people get that.

Um, but it's like a it, and it can be whatever you want, like it could be for the organization or whatever. Um, and then the Snow Foundation used to have ones, but they stopped. Theirs was really good. There was 200 grand just to put into your business. Yeah, right. And support. Um, but yeah, and it's, it is the type of thing where you pretty much just keep going for it.

And then the other one is the Westpac one, which [01:01:00] is more, uh, um, like you get 50 grand and then you travel around to support your brand as a social entrepreneur. Um, but Westpac's pretty good with that. Like Joe Qua got that and he got that. And, um. And have you heard of, um, Corey Tutt and Deadly Science? 

Speaker 50: No.

Speaker 51: So he's, he's free Rad too. He writes books on, um, first Nations Science. Oh, 

Speaker 50: okay. And 

Speaker 51: then he just, uh, he got the Westpac thing as well, but he's really good. He's got a very big ego. But, um, yeah, super nice follow. But yeah, these are the things you just like, um, almost just start going for, and like. They're good for just being in those networks and understanding that stuff and 

Speaker 49: Yeah.

Speaker 51: Because you, you've never been like social enterprise type model. 

Speaker 49: No, we haven't. We, we wanna, that's another thing that's been on our to do list every year [01:02:00] is to someone, 'cause it's been suggested to us, like if you have a social enterprise arm mm-hmm. Slash a charitable arm, it makes it, you're available to other funding opportunities.

Yeah. 

Speaker 51: DGR and stuff. Yeah. 

Speaker 49: But we just, again, haven't had time to sit down online 

Speaker 51: properly. 

Speaker 49: Cool. How to do it. What to do, yeah. That kind of stuff. Right. Ben was talking about, um, ORIC Tank too. Yeah. And Brody and man E's only the board member for, or Oh, for his own corporation. You get, you'd get exemption.

Yeah. So, I don't know. I'm, 

Speaker 51: I'm actually trying to do it for Sean, so we could do it as well for you guys. 

Speaker 49: So that's why I'm thinking well, we, yeah, maybe we can then, I don't know. I, 

Speaker 51: I reckon especially 'cause if it's two of you Yeah, I reckon a hundred percent because I 

Speaker 49: could do that tap because 

Speaker 51: you don't need be one off then.

And then that'd be, that'd be right. And [01:03:00] even if they come and say three.
