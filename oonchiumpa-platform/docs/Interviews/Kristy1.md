Kristy Bloomfield
===

[00:00:00] 

Speaker 59: Okay, so just just in case someone ends up editing this for me. Yeah. Just do your full name and spell it. 

Speaker 60: Yep. Kristy Bloomfield. K-R-I-S-T-Y-B-L double O-M-F-I-E-L-D. 

Speaker 59: Amazing. It's know where to start now because we know each other so well. I know so many things, but maybe if we start with.

Tell me a little bit about your feeling of home and country and that type of thing to kick us off, yeah. What's a little bit about your identity and just how you feel about being in this business. 

Speaker 60: Yeah. Yes, Christie Bloomfield central out east and out. Alia woman from Bantu, Alice Springs.

And so for me, central on my mother's side here. In Alice Springs as a traditional owner from her, from my bloodline through our mother she's, [00:01:00] the feeling we get is being living and born and raised in, in Barnwell, but also knowing that this is our great grandmother's country. And hearing the stories and knowing little stories around town.

Around our sacred sites, but also very sacred burial sites. You know that only us as traditional owners and family members would know of our ancestors around this area. But I also think, very, being very proud of who we are as well in terms of owning or and buying our own ho homes here.

And so that's exciting for us as traditional owners. Not only having, a cultural connection, but being proud of, our worth ethics and stuff, and being able to. Go into home ownership and stuff like that. So that's also very a proud [00:02:00] moment for, our mother and father.

My mother's also got connection from her side, which is northeast of Alice Springs. And so a community called In Blood and hatches Creek where, granny for our grandmother was born and stuff. Knowing that my uncles and grandparents used to live at Hatches Creek. Before, moving into Alice Springs and hearing, the stories out there, granny was a a full blood ADA woman from that area.

And my grandfather was an aboriginal central Outlander. Men that also comes from a Scottish background. And so with his Scottish father. And so my grandmother used to, put my two uncles in the sun to make 'em darker and blacker so that, the welfare wouldn't come and steal them from that area at Hatches Creek.

And they tell the TA stories of, when the police did arrive they [00:03:00] questioned my grandfather like. Who are these children and how come these children aren't removed? And my grandfather was like no, they're my children. And oh are you married to this woman? Yes, we're traditionally married.

And he was like the police officer was like that's not a thing. You need to marry this woman, otherwise I'm coming back to take your kids off you. And yeah. And so grandpa then took my grandmother to Tennent Creek and married her there the next week. And then the police did come back to Hatchers Creek.

And looked at the marriage certificate and was, oh, you, are you one of them smart black fellas? Aren't you half cast black fellas? And so these hearing, these stories really heartache of, because my grandfather was stolen generation. And he was removed from his grand from his parents and taken to the bungalow here.

So he didn't want that same experience for his own [00:04:00] children. And so in order to, for, to prevent that from happening, he married Nana in the church. So yeah, all of these stories, from my mother's side give us that, sense of pride and sense of, belonging. And knowing our rights, and so moving forward and feeling empowered from our ancestors, we're able to, be in a position we are, but also to challenge and make decisions for our families as well. Amazing. 

Speaker 59: How does that influence in history and acknowledgement of all that stuff like. Transfer into what you're doing with Lake.

Is that something in which is omni present all of the time? Yeah. What you need to be able to understand when to when to focus more on like quite specific now things versus telling that long story to young people. Yeah. Is that a Yeah, 

Speaker 60: I think. Knowing that [00:05:00] history of our grandparents and knowing our cultural connections I think it's helped us become who we are today.

But I think leading from a cultural culturally led, service provider, but also from their cultural authority as traditional owners and having. Provide evidence in the federal court and my auntie, being the forefront of all of that evidence. And with many other family members.

So I think for us, coming from a cultural authority perspective, we're able to lead this youth space and lead most of our programs and services. And I think also, from my father's side as an eastern ER man and coming from a traditional owner perspective from Loves Creek, we're able to then, expand on having that authority as well and to utilize this country we have out there as well.

Speaker 59: So one, one thing I [00:06:00] noticed and can't get past is. Is the amount of responsibility you hold across a number of areas across thing. Also from the station where we went yesterday to being on the board of Yeah. To working, to build. What's your, what's your approach with this? How are you able to, I think you talked about two worlds.

How are you. How do you every day sort of work within those two worlds? 

Speaker 60: Oh, look, it's very challenging and I think it's very. Draining at times. And I think a lot of pressure, but I think with the support of mom and dad and our team Adam Chupa we're able to thrive and really, bounce ideas and debrief on a regular for us to be able to get that off our chest and to be able to, wake up the next morning. All right, I know where I need to go. I know what I need to do. But it is quite, [00:07:00] yeah, we do have a lot of areas that we lead well, I lead and and in terms of, making sure we get the best out on Loves Creek, at the homestead, at the station, making sure we get the best form.

Lead that cultural authority led and challenging, government challenging other organizations and making sure that we're at the forefront in leading every aspect in our town. And for Chupa to be proud of something that we've been able to establish with us girls just being.

Able to continue to lead from a culturally led and, but also with that cultural authority to lead these programs and continue that. 

Speaker 59: What's the different areas in which, in terms of focuses on and what's the balance of direct working young people and then that like systems leadership and partnership with, what are the areas in which you need to focus on to.

To make the best outcomes for young kids. 

Speaker 60: Yeah. Look, I think our [00:08:00] relationship with these young people, having that relationship but also having that family connection because a lot of these kids, I. Know who we are as traditional Owners but also know who our families. So leading with those relationships and being in a position to pull 'em up when they are, doing naughty things and to not.

Reward bad behavior as many of our services do. And so we're in a position to really show other services how this culturally led with cultural authority service programs can lead here in Central Australia. And 

Speaker 59: what's what's an everyday sort of stuff that you do for young people?

Speaker 60: Yeah, so as part of Trumper, we, we're always reaching out to our young people to get 'em ready for school. Most of our young people, language is a barrier for them. [00:09:00] English is the third or fourth language, and so the challenges are the from the forefront. So we are definitely, in a position to encourage and empower them to attend.

School. So even though the, the education is very limited, we are always still encouraging them to go to school. We are looking for all of our broker brokers to partner with us and to also provide that Aboriginal cultural led programs and services for them because. Many of these Aboriginal businesses that we're working with have family connections with these young people have cultural authority with these young people.

So I think for us, being in a position to connect everyone together and also working with, our non-aboriginal businesses and stakeholders in our town as well, I think. Rewarding good behavior. When our kids do go to school for a week, a whole week, [00:10:00] that's a little win for us. May not seem like a lot, but when you're talking like the, when we are working with kids that have these barriers, it is a good win for us.

I think also connecting them with. Housing, making sure that their house is, able, they have food in their house, but also health, making sure that their health checks are all done as well. 

Speaker 59: What do you think the opportunity is for this narrative that's currently happening in Australia from Alice Springs being a place where the news reports come to, to show all of the troubles that's happening with young people to being able to show.

Change in young people leading, do you think that's a possibility of how do you think that could happen? 

Speaker 60: Yeah, look, I think there are, I think our town and the country. Lack empathy for our young people. The challenges that our young people are facing, overcrowding, housing, unfortunately family and domestic [00:11:00] violence in the town camps and also lack of food in the h homes for our kids.

So the kids that we work with. They're really, they're really good kids when we are working with them. Yes, they can be naughty sometimes, however they are looking for support for, from our service providers around town. I think changing the narrative and. And getting these kids a little ident, their own identity and being in a position to meet these kids.

I think our town need to open up and introduce themselves and our businesses need to meet these kids and have that opportunity to hear their little stories and know their names and their little faces. So I think for us, we, if we're working with in particular kids, we meet. The whole group, the, and their whole family.

So it's about understanding the family connections and their little friendships that they have going [00:12:00] on. 

Speaker 59: Hopefully gonna, if you have to go and talk to one little fellow the, what his name again? Sorry. 

Speaker 60: Jacqueline. Yeah. Jacqueline Button. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 59: Yeah, if that does happen, maybe it'd be awesome if you give your own little introduction to his experience.

Yeah. And. 

Speaker 60: Yeah, look, I think, it's unfortunate that our kids have to get to the bottom, of every aspect in their little lives to be able to thrive. Then, so this young fellow in particular, he has been through Don Dale. He has. Been through, the correctional center.

He has done this little, verse and this little rap that talks about he doesn't wanna be caught up in the system and he wants a normal life. So these are little things that the public don't hear about, and we wanna be able to share that with, the public to be able to listen to their little voices.

Speaker 59: What do you think his individual story was to get towards that? Experienced Don Dale, or was there a [00:13:00] specific thing in his circumstance that to those things. What are the things that lead him out? 

Speaker 60: Yeah, I think the challenges that led into that to being, naughty or getting into trouble was around peer pressure, and being, part of the gang, the, and that showing that he's, tough in that aspect.

What led him out to being to where he is now and. Off Operation Luna, not sighted uptown is that experience in Don Dale, away from family, away from country, but also away that he was restricted from visiting anybody and had to be isolated from everybody. So I think that's now led him to be, take a realization of what he needs to do to stay outta trouble, to remove himself from.

Peer pressure as well. 

Oh. 

Speaker 59: It's so fascinating to think about the ability for people like yourselves to be able to share those [00:14:00] positive stories. Young people as well. And there's a, it's a bit of a slide on the Australian community that they're not able to. Empathize with our, those young people. Yeah. Yeah. What's the next stage, umba, do you think, in terms of a supporting young kids where they are, but then also the vision for the future where the next young people, are seeing people like Jacqueline?

Yeah. Jacqueline. Yeah. As mentors. Yeah. And supporters rather than like negative. Influences, like what do you think the shift in that will be and how do we get there, 

Speaker 60: yeah. Look, I think, we already have, the young people that we're working with wanting to state are stating that they wanna be, youth workers here with us and they wanna be a part of, our fun days that we run.

And they wanna be able to, help these younger generation as well. I think if we can continue the programs that we're already offering and expand on those programs [00:15:00] and services, we will be in a position to. To make change for the next generation to be able to I wanna be like Jack one, will, I wanna be like the rest of these on Trump clip kids that are working with these mobs.

And I think showing and leading by example is the way forward for us. And we wanna be in a position to continue that on country and at loves Creek and in Barto as well. 

Speaker 59: What role do you think sharing of knowledge, not just across the communities of Alice Springs and Central Australia, but across Australia in terms of those practices, do you see an opportunity for, to be able to share what you're achieving here and then also learn from other communities around the Australia to.

What they're doing. 

Speaker 60: Yeah. Look, there's always room to learn more and get a, feel of what everyone else is doing across the country and vice versa. For them to, get an understanding of how we're able to engage with our young people, but how we're able [00:16:00] to get them connected to programs and services because many of our.

Young people wanna work with aboriginal people, and that's vital across the country. And a lot of aboriginal people will say that, Aboriginal people wanna work with aboriginal people and aboriginal kids wanna work with Aboriginal people. So I think that's our message that.

Aboriginal culturally led programs is working and has worked. And I feel the government should let that, let it be and let it continue to, run those programs the way we are running the programs. 

Speaker 59: Wonder little last question. 

Speaker 60: Oh, 

Speaker 59: Try to make it a good one.

I almost feel like it's a kind of a, sort of a punk rebel at heart. And I almost feel like Australia and especially Queensland and Territory are at a juncture of there's a certain portion of the community [00:17:00] up crime and wanna see kids punished and 

Speaker 61: Wanna 

Speaker 59: feel inverted from is safe.

But there's a whole bunch of research and practice that tell us that's the wrong thing to do. Yeah. It doesn't work. Do you have hope that we can find ways in which we can start to challenge those ideas and do that in a positive way? And how do you think we we do that as a whole?

Like how do we bring people along on that journey with us to tell that positive story rather than the risk punishment? 

Speaker 60: Yeah, I think, we have a lot of. Country as aboriginal people, a lot of, people wanna, build their own economic growth on our land. And I think we as Aboriginal people are in a position to make change and bring our own generational wealth on our own land.

And I think partners like the cattle industry, there's so much land. The mining industry, there's so much land that a lot of this big [00:18:00] entities like them wanna utilize our land. So why don't we then create our own generational wealth and bring those entities with us, and along with, for the journey but also, our businesses and towns, we have a lot of our young people attending, McDonald's to do traineeships with work experience with the owners there and there's a lot of businesses that are open for that to meet these young people. We need to start continue or what we've started continuing to work with all of these businesses, but also.

And bring them along with the jour, with our journey, but, and change that lifestyle for our young people, but also have our young people to have their own identity and connection with these businesses. Yeah. 

So cool. 

Anything else I've missed or anything else you wanted to say or 

free? I'm just thinking, no, I think, [00:19:00] yeah. Do 

Speaker 59: you wanna talk a little I guess I'll probably try and do the same thing with 

Speaker 60: your sister 

Speaker 59: and Yeah. But is there anything specific around the station and the property I think maybe you wanted to say Yeah. 

Speaker 60: Talk about, yeah. So I think, loves Creek, being a kid being a part of the land claim back in 1994.

With our old people, and learning the stories, hearing the songs and dancing the dances, it's something that, nobody can take away from us. And I think, having that strength and empowerment from our old people, we know what we want to do to build on our legacy, what our old people have left for us.

We're in a position to make change and bring. That generational wealth out on Loves Creek Station. And to be a part of these the cattle industry, which is a multimillion dollar business, we wanna bring that multimillion dollar business to our families on Aboriginal land and to [00:20:00] lead that.

Having pathways, having training developments out on country and meaningful training development programs for our young people to then gain employment out on the stock camp, out on these stations across the country. Having that experience and training. We will only thrive as aboriginal people.

I think years ago, our communities were operating as small little towns, having their own infrastructure machinery, having their own councils and running like little towns. So we wanna get back to what we've known prior to, government changing all the time on us. So I think for us, we.

We know what we wanna do on our land, and we want, we know how to get there. I think it's just about having, our land councils, our government supporting us in delivering this and having culturally led and having [00:21:00] our own, generational wealth on our land. Self-determination for us as aboriginal people, as we've, as our old people, have led the way for us.

Speaker 59: One, one of the stories that you told and stuck with me more than some other parts is just being on that stage and you're saying talking about the homestead Yeah. And how there is a complex relationship with the house. Yeah. Just because of the permissions that were afforded to.

Yeah. Your father family. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about that and why that. Why that is almost like a, an awesome opportunity, but also there's complications with that. 

Speaker 60: Yeah, look, loves Creek Station itself. Loves Creek was the original name for Ross River, homestead and Resort.

And so Loves Creek was the whole property. There were two out stations, which is at Napa homestead and Limba Homestead. And so at out at Nappa there, my father and his parents, and. [00:22:00] My, my auntie, they used to live out at Nappa with the family, rest of the family out there, and they were.

Walking distance to the old homestead. And so my father used to go up with granny, my granny used to live in go and care for the kids that white station owner kids. And my father used to go and, start the fire for the hot water system for the station owners. And so my father also, was, I came into Alice Springs for boarding school and would always have to go back during the holidays to help grandpa and Nana out on the station with, the station hand stuff. So the history, so after doing the native title, the land rights claim in 94, we then had the homestead back and so there is a lot of heartache there, but there is also a lot of, history around.

Our non-Aboriginal side and our aboriginal history. And so the old homestead out there [00:23:00] represents, the heartache that our granny felt, being, a slave out on our own country. I. The heartache of our father being fed in the water yard with the rest of the stockmen.

The heartache of, all of our old people being out there and having rations. So there's that heartache from our Aboriginal perspective and against the homestead itself. That also feeling proud of being able to be acknowledged and recognised in the federal court to having land rights out on the country is very proud for us.

And that was our land and that has always been our land as aboriginal people. So there's a lot around the homestead in terms of what we want to do. We wanna be able to share that history and showcase, the Aboriginal art, the aboriginal photos and history and also our non-Aboriginal side out there and showing that history.

There was the, world War ii they bred the horses out there [00:24:00] for the war. And so having that. non-Aboriginal history, showcasing that in the old homestead is what something that we're wanting to do but also sharing our Aboriginal side out there as well in history and connection to country.

Speaker 59: What's like the ultimate if you were to do a tour out there and people were on the homestead, there was the opportunity to work through the Bush talk and the history. It's like the ultimate way in which you would hope people feel, whether they were like. From China, from Australia, from like in terms of like human, A person.

Yeah. How would you want them to feel being there and what would you want them to learn? 

Speaker 60: Yeah. Look, first, welcoming to everyone, to Loves Creek at Napa homestead, but also giving, our guests an opportunity to hear both. Sides of our history out there. Because yes, it, yes, some history isn't great and, but our strength and where [00:25:00] we've gotten to is that amazing history of our aboriginal history out there.

Our connection to our country our sacred sites around the area. I think for our guests, we wanna be in a position to, share our knowledge and our history, but also share our hopes and dreams and our continued connection with the country and with our family members out there as well.

Speaker 59: So good. You've done so good. Oh, look at that half, half hour. 

Speaker 60: We'll see how we goes and how it turns out. Yeah. While you 

Speaker 59: here is anything else that you think you missed or. Or we kicking into the half hour? 

Speaker 60: Look, I think, our young kids unfortunately don't, didn't have the opportunity and don't have the opportunity that we grew up with, my mother and father had six children and dad, sorry.

Yeah, I think, our mother and father having six children, our [00:26:00] father, working hard with one income, he managed to send us all away for basketball all over the country. And that it really gave us an insight of, what it meant to be able to come from a loving family and.

Not always having everything, but always being, our dad being a provider, our mom caring for us, and getting us off to school. And I think these, unfortunately, these kids don't have that. And we wanna be able to share what we've grown up with, growing up on the station, mustering and being a part of, waking up and getting the horses ready for, dad and join in the must.

During team, but also traveling, for basketball and traveling the country with, our non-Aboriginal other players and being a part of that team. So I think for us we definitely wanna share our experience of, how we grew up and wanna share that with these young people in town as well and give them the opportunity.

Speaker 59: I don't know why I haven't [00:27:00] asked you this yet, because I was fucking. This morning I was looking into St. Mary's. 

Speaker 60: Ah, yes. Yeah. 

Speaker 59: And I'm not sure I'd love to walk you through it with you later just to see it's the right thing. But there's all this history stuff. 

Speaker 60: Yes. 

Speaker 59: Is the St. Mary's, we're talking about where the chapel is and it just got passed back.

Yeah. It bought by the government. Yeah. Three and that's it. 

Speaker 60: Yeah. 

Speaker 59: Fuck yes. There's so much history. There's so 

Speaker 60: much. So my, my auntie so Uncle Johnny's up there too, so it's cool. So Uncle Johnny's there, but my aunt my, on my mom's side, my aunties and uncles, they grew up at Angus Downs.

And so Angus Downs is south of Alice Springs. And so our grandfather owned a cattle property out there, sheep property in them. And so my grandfather and uncle Johnny's dad they, it got they boarded off the old grand great-grandfather. And so my grandfather sold his share to [00:28:00] Uncle Johnny's dad and the other brother.

And so Annie Pat, my auntie, she grew up at Angus Downs. She came in for St. Mary's boarding school to school. And so she tells the story of when she went to school that the nun was there. And so my auntie didn't know she ABCs they're going through. So my auntie goes, and so the nun's up there and she goes, A is for, and then obviously Apple and then and Auntie Pat never you knew what.

Fruit was like apple, never seen a red apple before. So she's like fruit and my auntie and she's whack with the cane. Yeah. And my auntie was, I think she was only like. Seven or six or seven, I'm not sure. Sure. Whack. And then, so anyway, now B is for they've never seen a bat. All the brothers, she talks about all the brothers had a stick, playing cricket, whatever.

And B is for stick the [00:29:00] whack, and then. Auntie talks like, the one thing she said when come to see. All right, go back to your seat. 'cause my auntie didn't know anything. Go back to your seat. She reckon the one thing that really hurt me. And she didn't ask me what sea was, and they had a lot of cats.

She tells that story. She reckon I would've got that one right. But then the next day she went back out to Angus stands for another year. Then she came back. Yeah. So a lot of history around St. Mary's like I. 

Speaker 59: All of this Yeah. Really? Yeah. There's even like a bunch of records Yeah. Of kids that went to, yeah.

Yeah. And there's a lot of I think it was a few years ago, there was conjecture around the purchase of it and Yeah, the chapel and is there a big. Mural inside the, 

Speaker 60: I haven't been, but we should definitely. Uncle Johnny would know more. Great. But [00:30:00] yeah, we should yarn him. But yeah. Yeah. There's so much history about St.

Mary's and so that's why thinking let's do it as a kid's place to bring back, the happy time, but also, change that whole. Perspective of, the horrible nuns that did horrible things to, our people. 

Speaker 59: Is this like some kind of like emergency firearm? I 

Speaker 60: don't know.

It's gonna be annoying in the background though. 

Speaker 59: That's or should we be running out the door with our hands flailing or, I, 

Speaker 60: I. 

Speaker 59: I was just, yeah, because I literally just started looking up this morning and there's a bunch of a, b, C stories and then there's like a Wikipedia page and then, and Ken and Uncle 

Speaker 60: Johnny would be great to have a yarn van and they'll tell you about St.

Mary's. 'cause I'm sure Ken's old, these old people would've went there. And Uncle Johnny, I don't know. I don't know. Uncle Johnny didn't go. 'cause he is younger than Annie Pat, but Annie Pat era. Yeah. 

Speaker 59: I can just see this old. 

Speaker 60: Yep. [00:31:00] Story missionary. Yep. 

Speaker 59: Of almost like you pay homage to the history and what happened.

Yeah. And then you acknowledge stuff and then it's and now what we're doing is we're like gonna be able to turn this history into a future of the kids. Yeah. 

Speaker 60: Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get that money, Ben.
