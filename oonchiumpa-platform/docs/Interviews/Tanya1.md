Tanya: . [00:00:00] Tanya Turner. T-A-N-Y-A-T-U-R-N-E-R. Cool. Let's do just what's your best I suppose always say just identify how you want to identify and then just a little bit about yourself. Fine. Okay. So I am Eastern or. Aboriginal woman from Central Australia. My family's country is from Emily to Jesse, gap all the way down behind the airport, and I've grown up all over Australia.

My dad was a minor, so we moved, lived in every state pretty much, but we always would come back to Alice and I always had a strong sense of. Justice in my life, not necessarily as a child, defining it as justice, but when I reflect back on my childhood, I always had this sense of things needing to be just and fair and equal for people.

And when I got to year 12 and all that pressure to put something on a [00:01:00] university application I actually. Got offered a position at n which is the Acting and Performing Arts in Queensland. 'cause I went to boarding school in Queensland in Charters Towers. And I threw that aside and wrote law on my uni application.

Much, much to my drama, despair. I remember she criticized me heavily for that. We had a big argument 'cause I had in my mom had said to me, you can't be an actor because being an actor is all about luck. You gotta be in the right place at the right time. It's not sustainable. So I ended up putting law.

And I got into an Aboriginal pre-law program at the University of Western Australia, which I know seems a bit odd. So my family's in the non territory. I was at boarding school in Queensland and I got into university in wa 'cause my Nan lives over there. So I had applied to go over there. And so I got into a pre-law program at UWA.[00:02:00] 

Which I went and did and then got into law school, which was the last year that you could do a straight law degree. So I didn't do a double degree, I just did a straight law degree, which on reflection, I wish I had done two degrees really? 'cause I think it gives you more opportunity and, but I did straight law.

Battled my way through a law degree. I think I got to my third year and I told my parents I was quitting and going up to the Pilbara to be a truck driver in the mines. 'cause I heard how they were earning like $150,000 a year and my dad being a minor was like, you're not doing that. So I pulled my way through my law degree and then I at the end of law.

Because it was a big deal coming from the NT and going to UWA. I think I remember my first day, and if I know if you've been to UWA, but it's very like grandiose old school. Oh, senior outside university. Very, [00:03:00] and I remember the first day I walked through the tunnel and I was like. Where am I? I was like walking on another planet.

I didn't, feel like I belonged. Spent most of my time at the Aboriginal Student Center and just hung out with all the other Aboriginal students. Never really got into uni life, if so when it was coming up to final year law and everyone was applying for the big law firms like Minter Ellison and, going for these big corporate firms and stuff, I was a bit like, I don't really.

Know what I want to do. That's not really what I envision myself doing. It's not my sort of people or anything. And this opportunity came through the Aboriginal Student Center. The Supreme Court of Victoria was looking for an indigenous associate. It was the first time they'd ever done role that was a dedicated indigenous associate judges associate role.

I was like, oh, that sounds interesting. Get to go live in Melbourne. And so I applied and I got the job. So I moved all the way [00:04:00] to Melbourne. I'd never lived in Melbourne or been to Melbourne in my life, and I had an amazing judge who was my supervisor in the Supreme Court, and I got to work.

With heaps of judges. 'cause I was like a roaming associate. So I got to work in crime, civil tax corporations, all the different areas that Supreme Court does, and I had an amazing experience. My judge really reinvigorated me. To want to be a lawyer and practice law. I was part of the Indigenous Lawyers Association and we actually did the case against Andrew Bolt for racial vilification.

We ran that matter when he did the article saying that where he had photos of fair skinned Aboriginal people and he was saying that they weren't black enough basically to, so we ran a. Case with a pro bono law firm against him, and we won when I was there. So that was a really [00:05:00] wonderful experience.

And then one day when I was in Melbourne, I'd been there about a year. I was getting on the tram and, all the people were like rushing and I just had this moment where I went, I need to go home. It just really. It hit me. I just went, I can't stay here anymore. This isn't, I need to go back to my home and to my community and use this law degree.

So I think I resigned two weeks later and I came home and it was the first time in my life driving from the airport into Alice. 'cause when you grow up in Alice or. You are like, oh, as a kid, oh, I hate Alice. All this stuff. But it was the first time in my life as I was driving in from the airport and I saw the Rangers and I went, wow, it's really beautiful here.

So yeah, it was the first time I had that realization. Came home, I got a job at a private firm in town. [00:06:00] Hated it. I became like the Alice Springs Debt recovery lawyer. So people at like netball games would be like, Hey, I got a letter from you. And I was, but I was also doing some child protection work.

So the law, the law firm I was working for, they were representing the child in a lot of matters. So I was doing a lot of that work as well. Didn't enjoy it. Hated billable hours. My boss was a real nutcase and the first job that I saw, Aboriginal legal aid advertising, I was like, I'm gonna go for it.

And it was a community legal education lawyer and I got the job. Who? And Auntie Pat. Who's Uncle Tony. And that's sister. She was the CEO there. She knew my family and loved that job. I did community legal education. Plus I was a civil family and child protection lawyer, so I did both roles and absolutely loved it.

I was going out Bush every second week. I'd [00:07:00] be often, under a gumtree teaching people about their rights and the legal system and at the same time doing civil law and stuff like that. So I did that for five years. And I ran the National Indigenous Legal Conference that Alice Springs hosted.

I project managed that while I was there. And then my mom had moved down south 'cause she couldn't afford land here and she wanted to have land and horses and stuff. And so after five years I thought I might go down south for a bit just to spend time with her. And I got a job as a family dispute resolution practitioner.

So I became a qualified FDRP, which is basically a mediator for family law. You've gotta be registered. And I did that for another four and a half years. I ran an office in Port Perie and I'd consider myself that I was a very good mediator. I had a 95% [00:08:00] success rate and I really loved it. But after that amount of time.

I was burnt out from it because you take on, as a lawyer, you just take on your clients, but as a mediator you take on the whole family. And I really wore me down over time. So then I come back, went to Naja, back with Christie. We did law and policy, CLE stuff and then the family court. And that's when we started talking about we need to do.

Something for ourselves. Like we've gotta stop working, grinding away. So yeah, that's a long story, but that's so awesome how I got, all I can say is that if he asked me back when I was at law school what I would've done with my law degree, I never would've envisioned that I would've done the things that I did.

That's for sure. I've just taken opportunities and rolled with it, so interesting but the feeling is not liking something and going changing, [00:09:00] but then when you look back, how awesome it is to have that like different experience Yeah. That you take with you. At uni I didn't even do family law because it's an elective.

I didn't even do family law and then I became a family, basically a family lawyer and an FDRP. That's the crazy part about it. What's what's this like. Country or place mean to you in terms of, you said that like you had a different feeling when you came back and that different connection is that something that continues to develop and Yeah.

How do you, like old fellas are talking today about, one of the things they find disappointing is that there's no respect for. Different people's country anymore, everyone's just drifting in and out and like feeling like they own this place. What's that experience like for you and your connection between two sort of countries, yeah. I think, there's no doubt about it, Alice has [00:10:00] changed significantly over time, especially since the intervention, the. But I've always felt like a strong connection to Alice, even though as a young person, I didn't appreciate the beauty. I've always, this has always been our home base.

We'd go away here, there in a robot. We always would come back to Alice. And so I feel that very strongly that connection to this place like this has always been home no matter where we've been. I think it is unfortunate that, in Alice Springs that it's not just Aboriginal people who have lost that respect for country, but that, we have a lot of people in our town now, and Alice has grown very quickly, but the majority of people don't know our story here.

They don't know the history, they don't know the story of Alice. They don't [00:11:00] know. The Aboriginal story, the white story, the mix of stories, both good and bad people are just existing in this place, but unless you know the story, how can you have empathy or connection to the place is my thing. Like when Christian and I were at Flinder's, we would do this cultural awareness training for all NT health staff.

And we would often have people come in and, I've lived in Alice for 20 years, lived in Alice for 30 years, blah, blah, blah. And then we'd do the session, which covers history and all these different topics. And by the end, they would be crying because I'd be like, I've lived here this entire time and I had no idea that this was what went on.

And 'cause we all know, despite what Jacinta says. That history makes up your present. The history does affect the present and it, even just hearing from those people saying, I understand a bit more now. I can [00:12:00] see where the issues are coming from. I can, so I think that's an unfortunate part of where we're at here as well.

It's not freely open and spoken about, but I guess that's Australia wide. We don't acknowledge our history and. I think Queensland was gonna do the truth telling inquiry, but then that got canned. 'cause I don't think it's about trying to make people feel bad, it's just about acknowledging that this is something that happened and this is what has gotten us to where we are.

So let's all work together to build from that. I definitely I walk straight down and there's that big brick thing in the middle and you walk up and it says. Some fucking person came here through here. Yeah. And he had a heroic journey and they had to put a park there. And then you walk up the road a bit and there's that fucking hero Bushman or something.

Oh, you saw this? The statue. Yeah. And I was like, fucking cool. Another big statue. And then you could see there's people's [00:13:00] camps underneath the white man holding the gun. Yep. Yeah. And it's like a very visceral moment for me. And then yeah, talking to those old followers about what life was like before and especially there's some complicated history there.

But what sort of gets me, I don't know if we've got this right or not, but in between those two points from then and now, there's been some shit go down. Yeah. And everything's gone pache for some reason. Yeah. Is there a certain sort of way in which you have to, I. Both. I understand that, but then look after the present kids and have you learned how to do that?

Or is this, is that like something you're still trying to work out? Like how can you acknowledge that middle, crunchy, horrible bit and then say to the kids, you can get out of that. You don't have to. Yeah. I think that, how I see it is learning and acknowledging that stuff informs how you go forward.

Because those kids don't understand, know the history, [00:14:00] they don't know what's going on. But in it informs you to have a greater understanding of the broader context in which you're working in. And I find, like Christine and I use that all the time, that background of knowledge and understanding and, 'cause even when we started at Flinder's, we learnt some of that stuff for the first time.

As well, and it immediately changed the way that we look at things or talk about things or how we decide we want to do things. Because education is power, right? Knowledge is power. That's how I see it impacting what we do. What's they what's what's the way have you found to be able to explain what in trauma does?

Services you do, is there, have you found a way to do that easily or is it something you're always still working at? 

Depending who I'm talking to. Like your everyday person. I explain it that we work with the most high risk young people in Central Australia and our role is. Twofold.

It's [00:15:00] as a cultural broker, so to link them and empower them in their identity as an aboriginal person, make them feel strong in that. Make them feel proud of their identity and ensure that their connection to their identity as an aboriginal person is maintained. And then the other aspect is to bridge the gap for them between that aspect of who they are and the western world.

So helping them to. Access education and health and all the things which other kids in town take for granted. Like we have a program in the NT where you get a sports voucher from the government, so it's a hundred dollars each semester that you can use to pay for your club fees for footy and things like that.

Yeah, and most kids, their parents just fill that out and do it, but it, our young people can't, don't even have someone who can go online and fill out a form for a sports voucher. So it's just giving them access to what everyone else has access to, but also linking them to the [00:16:00] community and making them feel a part of something that they're not outsiders looking in.

That's cool. What's a moment with a young person that has represented what you're trying to do? Is there something that's happened do you think that stands out as that's fucking really good outcome that you think about often? Yeah, I think, there's been a few I think the young girl that we worked with who had, a lot of, a range of issues including severe mental health and behavioral issues.

And now you look at her and she's got a job out in community and she's really got her independence and her life together. She's living out there and that kind of thing. That's a, was a huge success because. Everyone else had given up on her, basically. We had a young fellow who went out on country with us and after having that experience and seeing us, sharing knowledge with kids from interstate, he went back to his mob and now does the same thing with his [00:17:00] community.

Welcoming people from overseas and interstate and sharing his. Knowledge and culture and so empowering them in that way. That's cool. Obviously you're in a different head space now after being in a meeting and knowing that there's something coming. What's the what do you see as the everyday things that you hope to be able to do differently if you know that there's.

Resources available. Is there, are there certain things that you, 'cause there's always a thing Nick and I always talk about. It's like we run it trying to get paid for something or funding, and then you get the money and it's does any change? Yeah. What's the sort of everyday stuff you hope that you can continue to do better or build on?

Yeah. I think, in terms of our operating the program, I think. 

Ben: Build on our database and our data collection making that more efficient because I think, 'cause we've been in this sort of we won't we've just [00:18:00] been going along doing spreadsheets and things as best we can. But I think getting a better form of data collection we'll be important, a more efficient form for our staff as well.

But, I think. If we know, and obviously this is all an if, because we don't actually know what it is they're offering us, they're gonna offer us something. But what is it? If it's something that's a little bit more long term, I think it will just loosen the reins. I think. We'll feel free to dream again because I think we've felt so confined and constricted by.

Come June, do our staff all need to look for new jobs? Do we need to go? Do I have to go back to Flinders Uni? Like it hasn't allowed us to, while we have all these ideas, we hasn't allowed us to really dream them because everything's just been like treading water, I guess is the best way to describe it.

So I feel like if we have the knowledge that [00:19:00] we have some long-term security, we can really throw ourselves into. All right, what are, what's our goals? And now we can actually work to achieving those things. There's gonna be a bunch of randos coming up in June for this reintegration conference, and there'll be everyone from policy to a bunch of ex-prisoners to like impact data people, whatever.

If they get a chance to understand what's happening here, what would you hope that they take away? To understand Alice Springs and also what you were trying to do, what you, I think you know, anyone who visits, we try to get them to see the real Alice because the media paints a certain picture and it's a really bleak picture of Alice Springs.

And our thing is yes, there are negatives in our town, but there's also all these great positive things. And we, our big thing is well, [00:20:00] let us show you the negative and the positive, and at least that way when you see a media, article about Alice Springs, you can actually form an make an informed opinion about what is actually going the truth behind what's going on in our town.

And hopefully that opinion is informed by a little bit of empathy for the people that the media's portraying as well. There's a whole bunch of stuff happening in every community. Some of the things are like very similar and like visceral in terms of what's happening in Alice Springs and some of it's different.

If, do you do you see yourself trying to work out how you can. Understand what other places are doing and even visit and share that knowledge. And do you think that's helpful, yeah, absolutely. When we first started, these talks with NIAA, that was even a huge thing from their perspective because this was a pilot program.

The idea is if it works, [00:21:00] which we believe we've shown it does work, is to be able to take the similar ideas and concepts national and share it with other. Not just aboriginal groups, but groups in general this way of doing, especially aboriginal groups with that leadership and cultural authority.

So yeah, we love sharing and that cross knowledge base and things like that as well. And then going even broader had to go overseas, going to visit diagram. What do you think if they were looking at coming to Australia and thinking about how. Any of their model can translate.

What sort of tips do you think you have for them in terms of how they best come to a community and offer what they have? Like how's the best process to happen and what do you think could happen from that? In terms of like good shared outcomes? Yeah. In those ways? Yeah. You'd obviously target, initially you'd wanna target a specific.

Community. 'cause all of our [00:22:00] communities, while they have similar issues, we're also all very quite different. And I've looked at, read a lot about that model and stuff since talking to you and it'll be great to be able to bring some of that knowledge and ideas and I think, while we're all in this idea of justice reinvestment and alternatives to justice and things like that, it's a great opportunity to start having these conversations and putting some of these ideas on the table.

I definitely think you, it's a twofold thing. Obviously community, you can get on board and talk with community and consult and share ideas and thoughts. But I guess as we know in Australia, then you've gotta deal with the political. The political aspect of how that could work or what we could do to implement that or pilot program where maybe it's run by an Aboriginal group as a pilot program or something, as a [00:23:00] diversion option or how you could scale it down initially to sell it and then.

You go, all right, let's tackle it on the larger scale. That's really good. Yeah. On the same sort of point an idea is there's indigenous groups everywhere around the world. How do you think we start to share those marginalized perspectives and almost think about what's the things that are.

Shared knowledges and practices and stuff we can bring into Australia and yeah, I guess how do it's almost like that two worlds thing again. It's like how do you cut through this thing of indigenous knowledges can be part of this new modern Yeah. Academic and practice thing.

How do we make sure that those historical know stay part of the practice? Yeah, I think about this quite a bit because I've always been quite internationally minded in terms of sharing knowledge and experience [00:24:00] and I often think about the only time I know that there are small pockets of indigenous groups sharing knowledge on specific things, but.

When you think about the only time as indigenous people that were actually brought together to share knowledge on a global is at the un. And that's an intense space. And really a lot of the time it's just a talk fest. Like it nothing, you don't really hear much coming out of the indigenous people sessions of the un, other than people just going and sharing their story, but no real policy or.

Great big declarations come out or anything like that from those events. Finding ways that we can create these groups where we have these annual abilities to come together and talk about these things and create statements or things which actually [00:25:00] cause global traction.

Because I think at the moment. As indigenous people globally, we talk between ourselves and we create things within ourselves, but the rest of the world doesn't take notice. It's just something that we are left to figure out on our own kind of thing. Yeah, I feel like, especially in Australia it's yeah, the Olympics and they were like, a few people saw some people dancing around.

Yeah. Yeah. And that's kind of it. Yeah. And like I'm always fascinated when you go to. Like being in Asia or being in the Middle East or something and the amount of knowledge people have around, yeah, indigenous groups is like a boomerang or fucking a Yeah. And it's fascinating 'cause when I've gone to America just for a holiday, I specifically sought out the opportunity to go meet other indigenous people and hear about.

And I think that's what indigenous people globally do. Like we seek each other out because we wanna share knowledge and, but there's [00:26:00] not that stage for those conversations to become like, alright, as a global group, this is what we want. The world, this is a best practice or this is, how things should be done.

There's start this again. There's. I feel like there's a massive tension between white people feeling like they have to go through some kind of process or ceremony versus this is an exchange of knowledge and information. Yeah. It's fucking the thing that I get upset about most, I think is it turns into what someone forcing you to do.

Yeah. Versus how do you best understand Yeah. And I don't think I'll ever have to understand. Yeah. But that's where we talk about allies, right? It's about letting Aboriginal people lead, but being an ally on the side to, whereas I think in [00:27:00] Australia we've got that upside down completely, we're not, we're given the opportunity to be consulted with, but you're never given the opportunity. Or we are a little bit now, but it's rare that you're consulted with and then told, Hey. So from that consultation we came up with this, do you wanna do it? It'll be like, oh, from the consultation we came up with this and we've brought in this group to do that for you now.

It's awesome. To, that sort of leads me to this last question, which is just been fascinated at your journey so far, and. Like what you've been able to achieve and what's this like? I think the thing in which I've realized the most is that there is still a lot of influence in how you are able to control what you can do.

And there's a lot of people coming in and operating in a sense of experts or ownerships or whatever. What's this like [00:28:00] in five years, what would you hope that you are able to. Be acknowledged as and being able to almost take back some of those things that are being forced upon you.

What does that look like in maybe five years to to think about whether it's from Cho or Alice or whatever? I would hope that we would be at the forefront of change. And not just for young people, but for Alice as a place. To bring it back to that vibrant, multicultural, accepting community that we did once have with the youth, I hope that, 'cause we're doing this research project at the same time that we're able to set some best practice.

Through that research and to be able to share with the rest of our community across Australia. This is what works and this is how you do [00:29:00] it with Aboriginal young people. But I think my vision is that, yeah, we're able to help bring our town back and that's why we started. This is 'cause we care about Ban as a place.

Our young people, unfortunately, are just collateral in a bigger issue. The issue doesn't sit with them. It sits on a much broader level and with adults, not with children. 

Tanya: Working towards how we as an Aboriginal community bring back our lives, create something for our people to want to live for.

Because I think at the moment our people really have nothing. To drive them. There's a lot of sadness and despair and hopelessness, all compounded by racism and alcoholism and domestic violence and all these things. And it's about us working together all our different language groups. [00:30:00] To go, let's take back our lives.

This isn't a way to live. We can't keep living like this, and become members of this community and lead this community in the way that we know we can fuck Sarah. Anything else I missed you think that you wanted to make sure you said No? I think that's good. So rad.
