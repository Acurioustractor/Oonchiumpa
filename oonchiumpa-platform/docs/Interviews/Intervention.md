Intervention presentation
===

[00:00:00] 

Any thoughts, feelings, comments? Has everyone heard of the intervention? Yes. Most people.

I was thinking, um, I wonder like if I went my. About the connection, whether given that there was no efforts made to clear the reputation of these communities, whether my parents are still, I guess, uped by the media a whole still at the time, and like I think that we, because yeah, I didn't realize that there was never,

and I think there's a couple of key points which we'll talk about, but. So obviously as it [00:01:00] ended is the concept of the ulterior motive of the intervention and why the ulterior motive seems so justified or real is because a part of the intervention, a key part of it was they took away all aboriginal control of communities on aboriginal land.

So before the intervention, um, Aboriginal communities had their own aboriginal boards. Um, and they ran their communities. So, you know, a community like Maju was quite a thriving community. They had a mechanic shop, they were running their store. Um, they had their governance board. Um, and a lot of communities had that.

They had work for the DOLL program. So, you know, they had their own rubbish collection. Um, they had a lot of their own infrastructure and machinery so they could maintain their own roads and all these types of things. And a lot of communities had this. So is another one. Um, sort of the bigger communities had all this [00:02:00] infrastructure, which they would then help the smaller communities surrounding them with that infrastructure.

So they took away that control. So they stripped all the communities of their boards, um, and they brought in what they called government business managers, which were basically bureaucrats from Canberra, who they flew in to basically sit and control the community and report back to government on everything.

Was going on community. So for Christie and I, um, were family education, you know, prior to the intervention, you would, like you said, we'd contact elders and the community, the, um, aboriginal board to get permission to come before you'd come, before you came, like the day before you would ring up to make sure there was no, sorry, business or other cultural things happening in community.

That meant that you couldn't come pretty much the next day after the intervention. There was no more. Aboriginal person, you were ringing this white person and they would give you permission to enter the [00:03:00] community. And sometimes they wouldn't let us. Sometimes they'd say, no, sorry, you is closed. You can't come in.

And so that was a big thing that happened. And then the government business managers gradually transitioned into Shires or these super shires. So we've got Barkley Shire Council, McDonald Shire Council Central Desert Shire. So now they control the communities. So their offices are all in Alice Springs or Tenant Creek, and they now have taken over that government business.

So they control all services in communities and you know, when you talk to people, they're a real headache. Um, so that's what's happened now. So AB people still don't have control. The intervention ended in 2023, but. Aboriginal people still don't have control of their communities. 'cause the Shias have all the control.

And why that causes issues is because [00:04:00] what's happened is in the past, if the community identified something that they needed, so they say, they said, look, we need youth stuff, we need stuff for our youth. Before the intervention, the community could basically go and tender to services and be like, look. You know, you've got a great program.

Can you come to our community and provide it? So now that role's been taken away. So now what happens is the Shire identifies what services a community needs. The Shire tenders for it, and they decide who's gonna get the contract to go to a community to provide a service. So aboriginal people's voices are completely taken out of the equation.

So the Shias have an aboriginal board. Hmm. But as we talked about before, they're usually members who don't have a high level of education and you know, their priorities are the [00:05:00] everyday things. So on a broader scale, there's no one there to help them advocate, you know? So they've gone to a board meeting with like a white CEO of the Shire who easily can overrule them because there's no one helping them advocate for their community.

Chris.

Yeah, no, I, I mean, I, I wasn't, I was, I had left in 2005, came in 2007, and I, I feel able to potentially comment on what I think is an aftermath, a kind of before and after. But, um, I think you have that, you, you take the floor on the impact. Um, yes. And I think, like Kenya said, you know. For us traveling to remote communities prior to the intervention, you know, operating as small little community towns, you know, and we felt, you know, very proud going to, you know, our Aboriginal leaders in community because they were, you [00:06:00] know, had that strength behind them.

They had the community behind them and being able to navigate us what support they needed. And I think, you know, after going. After the intervention, you know, even for court, you know, the court lists weren't that big, you know, going to court and, and, and, you know, supporting, you know, your lawyers in court.

Um, but now after the intervention, they're stacked up because there's so much, you know, heartache and so much, um, destruction gone through the community. It's a real tragedy. Tragedy at the moment. I think during that era as well, a lot of our aboriginal men, our uncles, our fathers, you know, they were looked upon as pedophiles in the stores.

And, you know, it was a really, you know, disheartening time, a very emotional time for us. And, you know, we were only still young and kind of figuring out, wait, what are they saying about, you know, you know, our uncles and the, you know, aboriginal men. [00:07:00] And so it was really horrific time for them because. You know, a lot of senior Aboriginal men were looked upon from government and, and, and it was really, um, just a challenging time for our fear in central Australia and throughout the territory, really.

Um, I think, you know, like I talked about the, the kids being removed and, and seeing, you know, the, the heartache of the parents trying to come in and have access to those kids and keeping in mind, you know, there was no one ever charged for. Any, um, sexual assaults or anything in community. And so we're now dealing with, you know, a lot of our young people, um, that have been removed from, you know, their parents and their families and from community.

We now see the aftermath of, you know, these kids that are now, you know, running amuck in a town because that's that age gap of between, you [00:08:00] know, 16 and 17 years old. And they're the kids that we're dealing with the intervention kids and, and so it's really challenging for us now to try and rebuild their little identities and, and rebuild the parents as well.

And I think nobody makes that correlation. That intervention is 17 years ago this year, 16. And all of these kids are intervention kids now. These are all kids who have grown up through the intervention. Hmm. And like Anthony said, and we'll probably talk on this is the result, and Aboriginal people told the government that this is what's gonna happen if you do these things.

You know? So another part of the intervention was the basics card. So the, um, apportioning of money for certain things. And Aboriginal people said to government, if you do that, the parents aren't gonna have money to buy the kids, this, that, and the other. The kids will start stealing. They ignore it. Sure enough, the kids started stealing stuff from [00:09:00] the shop.

Yes. And so, you know, even the kids who weren't removed, they're still grown up through this period where they've grown up around the dysfunction that's resulted in the intervention. And like Christie said, you know, a lot of families turn to alcohol. Um, the violence and the alcohol abuse, you know, increased dramatically through the intervention period because not only was the, the, you know, being labeled as pedophiles.

Some children being removed, but they also took away the jobs. Yeah. So, you know, in the communities they had CDP and work for the dog programs and they had functioning, um, community councils. So people had jobs, you know, garbage collection, mechanics, the shop, um, administration roles, the school, there were all these jobs for people in the community.

And overnight they took that all away. So people had [00:10:00] nothing, you know, they had no way to sustain themselves or contribute to their community or to their family because they had no employment as well. So, you know, the alcoholism increased and consequently the violence increased and these kids have all grown up around this.

Um, and so we always talk about that, you know, these poor little kids are intervention kids, and no one ever thinks about how they've gotten to this. I think another thing, when Tanya and I, you know, traveled through community after the intervention, you know, they had these big ugly signs up that you would've seen in the film, and so they were at every town camp in Alice Springs, there were at every aboriginal living space and, and every community when you drive into community now, but keeping in mind you're, this was, yeah, 16, 17 years ago.

Tanya and I going out to community, we wouldn't have reception. So a lot of our mob, when we would do [00:11:00] community legal education, they were like, well, what does that mean? What does pornography mean? Like what? What are they saying about us? And so we never had reception in community and none of them mob had reception.

So it was really challenging trying to explain that, well, obviously they're gonna research. Well, what does that mean then what are they saying about us? And so it really did kind of. You know, shone a light on, well, Aboriginal people didn't understand what they were being blamed for. Um, and then led to researching that and then led to, you know, really challenging times and, you know, very distressing times for our MOBING community as well.

And there, I remember there was one sign at the front of Mum and. Um, and mom's block there and our uncle Uncle Mickey just ripped it down and threw it down the creek and it was the biggest sign. And he is like, this is bloody not a town camp. And we, we don't drink here and we don't do this, and all of that.

So just [00:12:00] really degrading, you know, our aboriginal men and, you know, and aboriginal communities in that way, you know, and all, all because of the lie. It was really, yeah, really challenging time. Two big things that I think I noticed, but I wanna check with you two, is I think that what, what you hear loud and clear from what you're saying is that authority structures and self-determination was dramatically uncut.

And so that's, that's again, that a sense of just the history repeating with colonial control. But also that also means you don't have your role models. You know, you, you. Suddenly you're demonizing those that would otherwise show a pathway to, and, and also respect for aboriginal law and so on. And the other one is just straight out grinding poverty that's added, which means that people, and this is more of a question, but it seems to me it's harder to be a kid on a community.

You know, it's, it's because the services aren't there [00:13:00] because actually less people are getting sent to them. There's actually less money. Mm-hmm. Does either of those things resonate with you too? Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, even for us, when we go to community, we're always doing a shopping before we go because, you know, the prices, you know, living on community are expensive.

You know, fuel, fuel and food. And so a lot of our kids that we do work with, you know, and even on community, you know, we're, we're often buying little snacks here and there to take out for, for these kids on community. So yeah, I think definitely. Um, and I think the other huge aspect to talk about with the intervention is the media yet again, um, you know, the role that the media play, this is basically all sparked by their role.

And, you know, we can really relate to that in our present day because the last two years we've again had trial by media. Um, and the picture that's painted, not just [00:14:00] nationally, but around the world of Alice Springs. This is so wrong, and you know, for us here in Central Australia, it's more than just an interview with a guy who owns a bakery.

Because for us, we know that, oh, are the army trucks gonna roll in tomorrow? Because this one white person's gotten on the TV and told everyone that kids are being raped. You know, that's a reality for us because that's what happened with the intervention. The Army trucks rolled in, so. You know, in Raju, the army set up camps where they were, um, health checking children, um, and sort of taking control of the community, which is in Australia, the only power to do that is in an emergency.

Um, so you can bring the army in an emergency, which is usually in things like floods or fire or things like that, where there was a natural disaster that they used that power. In this instance. And the army rolled into the Northern [00:15:00] Territory. So people in Raju woke up to Army trucks, literally driving towards their community.

And when you think of the history you've worked today, you can understand how terrifying that must have been. You know, what the tells going on here. Um, so for us, you know, in the last couple of years we've had a lot of false media. Um. Portrayed internationally. You know, we get people from overseas who come and we like, oh, we saw on the news when we were in England or, or about Alice Springs.

And at one point in the last couple of years there was a nurse, um, who did a very similar thing. She got on to spy news on Fairfax Media and she went international. Some of you might have saw it. Claiming that as a nursing community, she had seen all these sexual abuse of kids. And this was maybe in 2023.

Yeah, yeah. S yeah. 2023. [00:16:00] And we came to work the next day. Yeah. And we were literally like, oh my God, are the army truck's gonna roll in tomorrow? This white women's spot as a nurse, and said that kids are being sexually abused again. It was later found that. She had never lived in an aboriginal community.

She was a Botox nurse and she ended up in Darwin court for fraud. Fraud. Yeah. But that was never corrected, like the intervention that was never publicized or corrected. Um, but for us here, you know, those kinds of allegations can cause real trouble, um, for us here. And I think when we were lecturing, you know, even the nurses and the doctors were, you know, just.

You've blown away with what statement she was saying and never seen her in, in any hospital or any, you know, community working. And she's here, out here making these allegations for, you know, our young Aboriginal children on community [00:17:00] and, and it still happens today. We'll see news stuff on the news. You probably see it now that you currently.

So I do like a news report on Alice Springs, but they'll use old footage of kids, like on the council lawns or girls fighting, and we are like, hang on, that footage is like two years old. But they, they recycle the footage to keep the momentum up, innocence.

It's been Alice Springs, maybe other aboriginal communities. Okay. Alice Springs has become sort of like, if you want to make a statement about aboriginal affairs, it's the place to come because the work, the nation will Muslim. It's kind of like the Uluru statement from the heart. If you want the [00:18:00] nation to hear what you're saying.

You go to somewhere like Uluru because as soon as people see Uluru, they're like, Ooh, Uluru, I'll take notice. And Alice Springs has become that. So as soon as like a politician steps into Allison says something, it suddenly gets nationwide. 'cause we build ourselves a reputation, I guess you could say. And the politicians do it both sides of politics.

They both do it all the time. They'll just fly in in the morning. They'll go somewhere, make some absurd statement. Who's that statement? Just center May in the referendum center. So we have a Facebook page here called Action for Alice. Mm-hmm. It's the source of all evil. Mm-hmm. If you have Facebook and you want to go on there, you can.

Um, so action for Alice's sort of instigated all our current issues, I wanna say. Mm-hmm. Um, it's sort of like late law, the version of Facebook. [00:19:00] Um, so he posts everything that's going on in Alice throughout the territory. Well, yeah. Recently he's a self professed savior of Aboriginal kids and, um, he got momentum, like he got international momentum.

Um, and so Jacin Price came in and did interview Amelia.

Because she knew that that would grab attention. But I saw stupidity. Mm. All the stuff that happens, analysis from a Guide Bakery and our kids that we work with, they see all that. Mm. If you go on there later where Facebook go on there, have a walk, read the comments, underst stuff, and the kids see it and they kind of say to us, 'cause they see what the community says about them through this page, and they kind of say to us, well, if that's what everyone thinks about us.

Mm. Like, why? Why would we, [00:20:00] blah, blah? Nobody wants us, they talk about us like this. I think one thing with the intervention, and I hoping I'm not getting this wrong, so correct me if I, but that the Howard government and Bru used it as a political football in an election and that happens over and over again and it created them some real momentum and it then triggers back into that story of seeing the white people as.

As saviors and looking after these poor, you know, can't tell our own story mob from, from central Australia. And it's just like this cycle. Mm-hmm. And as you said, each time there's some flash point, you think about it like that recent one with, you know, the young people outside the tide. If you'd had a different government or a different election cycle or something, you could well have had an intervention mark too.

And it, and that was what a lot of people would were thinking. So, and I think it's 'cause it's iconic, it's the center, it says something, but [00:21:00] what it says, you know? Yeah. And, and you know, in terms of starting in 2006 under liberal government changed to labor. They were both in on it. And then the next year, less than 12 months later, Kevin Rud said, sorry.

So for me, when I didn't even listen to Kevin, I, sorry, I'm sorry. Don't listen to, 'cause I'm just like, but yeah, but for those people who experienced it, it was important for them. Mm-hmm. And so not downplaying it, but for me, in the head space that I was in at the time, I was like, this just seems so contradictory.

Like, why are we even giving this man air time when this is going on? And you're over here, so sorry. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And the only other thing I'd say is if you look sort of historically, they took about periods and there was a period which, you know, rightly or wrong was described as a period of [00:22:00] self-determination where there probably was a higher degree of partnership and trying to build something that was, um.

You know, which, which, which could have amounted to a communication between laws or between peoples and so on. And the intervention kind of, it just cut that, it, it's almost brought in a whole new period of paternalism, which is almost so when, when you look at it that way, um, yeah, it's, it's very powerful in terms of the way it then sits nationally, not just here.

Yeah, yeah. Nationally as a way of kind of, I think it was unfortunate that. The intervention ended as the referendum was. So like it. So the intervention ended in mid 2023, right? Last year, yeah. Yeah. And within a couple of months of it ending, they brought back all the alcohol restrictions so that were within the intervention.

So we have very strong alcohol restrictions here. Most communities throughout the [00:23:00] intervention, they were dry communities. You couldn't drink in them. And also if you go to purchase alcohol at the, um, Bronx, you'll show your id, you get scanned, you get with your Aboriginal, you get asked when you're taking the alcohol.

They have, they have banned drinkers, registers. It's all very, and now we have the alcohol outlets are shut on a Monday, Tuesday. Um, so very strong alcohol laws. So within a couple of months of the intervention ending, they brought that all back. Hm. And for us, one of the things that they did, which we find a bit controversial, is they gave communities the option of remaining a dry community.

And for us it's a little bit controversial in the sense that what that did is for those fear that you chose to remain dry, is it, put it back on our, the people who still have to deal with the alcoholism. 'cause the only way to access alcohol is really comes to Alice Springs on people's country. So we're still responsible.

For people coming here to drink. [00:24:00] Um, so it's a little bit of like, you know, should the community so that the communities could take responsibility for that and what that looks like going forward and shaping how they deal with that problem, um, going forward. But yeah, and then the referendum happens the next year, which is, I think, a bit unfortunate.

It probably all just compounded. Um, with, you know, with the intervention ending and the alcohol laws coming back in and the kids running them up and the referendum being a blow for a lot of people here. It all just kind of, and then the change in government Yeah. Late last year to a very stor liberal, you know, lock everyone up and kind of is all compounded into this situation, right?

Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Which I think the courts are very. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we will talk about it more, but if you have a look at some of the, what's going on with incarceration rates here, they've [00:25:00] just blown out massively, uh, in the last sort of six to eight months, like enormously. Um, and there's been a bunch of kind of good articles and graphs and so on in the, in the Guardian and, and they're, they're often, it's hard to kind of pin it down.

One thing that settled with me was that if the Northern Territory was a state. Um, sorry. It was a country then it would have the second highest incarceration rate in any recorded country in the world. Only behind El Salvador. And when well over 90% of those people locked up are Aboriginal people from here.

And when the reason, once you just pay a little bit of attention to the, the history is that blinding poverty, the cutting of authority structures, the, the kind of. Almost deliberate attempts to remove hope and say, look, if you can't be white, you don't have value. Then there's an obvious story of why that's happening and it's [00:26:00] being met with this completely illogical narrative, by the way I'm speaking not as a on behalf of the court, but um, just a completely illogical narrative that somehow that's a whole bunch of people choosing and this is something that will restate that, you know, that invites you.

Unless it, it basically is pushing a narrative that aboriginal people are innately criminal. And, and unless you accept that, it sounds absurd when you, you say, but actually that's what the, the narrative story is because once you unpack it, it's, it's all of these structural things and sadly and tragically there on lots of measures getting worse rather than better.

And that goes the same with child removal. It. And all of that comes back in a lot of ways to this absence of authority and control, self-determination and, and capacity to listen. Mm. Uh, and a lot of these stories with this, I mean, this guy in his hat, I mean, I, it's, it's, it's, that's quite a revealing, that really pulls a lot together.

But [00:27:00] those are the extreme ones. But the place that's been set by mostly white people coming in, spending a little bit of time deciding they're the authority. And then seizing the stage, making careers out of it. I mean, it accused we're all, we all have to have humility around that, including myself and what I've benefited from being here as a non-indigenous person.

But it's just this ongoing kind of narrative, which is about power and control. It's about power control, which is why when Patricia Moore, um, Thomas Thomas, you know, says, well, when we connect the dots, sure. Like it. For this, isn't it? It's about land. Well, you know, it's hard not to see. It's about power and control, whether that manifests in minerals or just some other forms of control and wealth and so on.

Um, and I think you're right, Anthony, that, um, I [00:28:00] don't know anyone's heard of Dr. Tracy Westerman. She's an aboriginal psychologist. Um, in 2023, she wrote an article where she gave the actual stats of child removal for aboriginal children. And even in the intervention, you know, the majority of, um, aboriginal kids who are removed is not for sexual abuse.

It's actually for neglect and neglect related to poverty. So it's something that can be fixed as a society. Um. And these kids are being removed for that thing, but that doesn't really get advertised. Something like 75% is the midwife. Um, so you know, not going to school, not having clean clothes, you know, maybe attending health clinic because you've got scabies or things like that, or like to, you know, poverty and overcrowding and things like that.

Um, very few relate to abuse of children [00:29:00] in any way. Um, sexual or non-sexual. Um, and that was even during the intervention, that was what was found. But Dr. Tracy West has some really good reports where she talks about, she's from wa so a lot of her stuff is wa but she does does have one where she talks nationally about child renewals.

Does anyone have any questions before we move on to Ken? Total questions. Can I just want, sorry. The question of the comment as well. One of the things intervention, um, was, was, uh, exposed the ideological background because it had nothing to do with helping children. Is that I didn't really follow up. Is that still creation and industry?[00:30:00] 

Yeah, and I mean, we talked about before the current proposed changes to sacred sites and things like that, but one thing that happened during the intervention is suddenly all these roads were being made where there was no before and it all, they all turned out to be leading to where there was a mine, like a closet or like an exploration.

Um. So, yeah, I think that stuff's still evolving. I mean, as you know, up north, they're fiercely fighting. There's a bit beetaloo, the fracking. Um, and as I said in that video, you know, t meant to be the new frontier in terms of like, um, land rights lives. We'll talk a bit more about that out at Love Street and the impact of leasing and things like that out there.

Panic. [00:31:00] Yes. Yes. Major panic. Yeah. Did you wanna add anything else? Oh, I was just gonna say, I, I think what you've seen, it's pretty full on. I was only dipping in, this is a big day, like I remember this day from past forces that it's, there's a lot in it and it's important. And I think one of the messages that will be reinforced is that sense of history in the present.

And it's all really right here now. And I think the other thing you see is just continual violence. Violence against establishment, people manifesting in all sorts of ways, often in the guise of we know what's best. We'll control your life. And the product of violence, as you've seen, is trauma amongst other things.

And that trauma just keeps flow. And again, I don't know if you've done the trauma pieces today or that's coming, but that is what you see. Well see what you see in the court, and you may not see it. It will be sanitized. Basically what I see every day is the product of trauma and, and [00:32:00] that's violence and it, and it's, uh, in every way, but we have to think about where is that come from and what keeps reinforcing that, and then who is getting responsible and who is said to be responsible for it because they're the, in the narrative of individual responsibility.

In those situations is just, it's very, it's the overarching theme of it and a way of getting more control. Thank you. No worries. Thank you. I'll see you all for dinner. I'll meet you here and then we'll walk over you, Anthony, you.
