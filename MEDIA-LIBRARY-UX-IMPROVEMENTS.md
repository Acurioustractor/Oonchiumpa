# Media Library UX Improvements - Future Enhancements

This document outlines suggested improvements to make the Media Library easier and more intuitive to use.

## üéØ Priority Improvements (High Impact, Easy to Build)

### 1. Default Values for Common Use Cases
**Problem:** Users have to fill in the same information repeatedly
**Solution:** Add "Quick Upload" presets

```typescript
// Example presets
const uploadPresets = [
  {
    name: "Youth Program Photo",
    category: "service-photos",
    tags: ["youth-mentorship", "Youth Programs"],
    cultural_sensitivity: "community"
  },
  {
    name: "Public Event Photo",
    category: "community-events",
    tags: ["Community Events"],
    cultural_sensitivity: "public"
  },
  {
    name: "Team Photo",
    category: "team-photos",
    tags: ["Team Photos"],
    cultural_sensitivity: "community"
  }
]
```

**UI Addition:**
- Add "Quick Upload Templates" buttons above the upload area
- Click a template to auto-fill common fields
- User just needs to drag photo and click upload

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** High ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

---

### 2. Bulk Tagging
**Problem:** Uploading 10 event photos means typing the same tags 10 times
**Solution:** Allow setting tags once for multiple photos

**UI Addition:**
- Checkbox: "Apply these tags to all selected files"
- Show preview: "These 10 photos will be tagged: youth-mentorship, Event 2024"

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** High ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### 3. Visual Cultural Sensitivity Guide
**Problem:** Users unsure which level to choose
**Solution:** Add visual examples in the form

**Current:**
```
Cultural Sensitivity: [dropdown]
```

**Improved:**
```
Cultural Sensitivity: [dropdown]

[Shows example based on selection]
üåê Public - Good for: Group photos, landscapes, public events
üë• Community - Good for: Participant photos, program activities (currently selected)
```

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Medium ‚≠ê‚≠ê

---

### 4. Drag-to-Categorize Gallery
**Problem:** Photos uploaded to wrong category, no easy way to fix
**Solution:** Allow dragging photos between categories in Gallery view

**UI:**
```
[Team Photos] [Service Photos] [Stories]
   ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
[Photo Grid]   [Photo Grid]   [Photo Grid]
```

Drag a photo from one column to another to recategorize.

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

---

### 5. Smart File Naming
**Problem:** Uploads called "IMG_1234.jpg" not descriptive
**Solution:** Auto-suggest title from:
- Folder name if uploaded from "Youth Camp 2024" folder
- EXIF date: "Photo from March 15, 2024"
- Event in calendar: "Atnarpa Visit - March 2024"
