    title: "Atnarpa: Coming Home to Country at Loves Creek Station",
    excerpt:
      "The journey of the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family to reclaim their ancestral lands and build generational wealth through cultural tourism and cattle operations at Loves Creek Station.",
    content: `There's a place east of Alice Springs where the red earth meets the sky, where a homestead built in 1933 stands testament to over a century of Aboriginal connection to country. This is Atnarpa - also known as Loves Creek Station - and it represents something profound: the journey of the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family to reclaim their ancestral lands and their vision for the future.

## The History Lives in the Land

Atnarpa's story begins long before the cattle station was established in 1896. This land has always been home to the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family - a connection maintained through cultural ceremonies and rituals even when they were pushed away from their own country.

The old homestead itself tells a story. Built with rocks from the local area and clay from the swamps around Loves Creek, mixed with spinifex grass as a binder, its 2-foot-thick walls keep the house cool in summer and warm in winter. During World War II, the pioneering operation bred horses for the Indian Remount trade. But for the Aboriginal Bloomfield family working there, it was a complicated place - their own country, yet one where they faced profound injustice.

As Kristy Bloomfield shares: "There's a lot of heartache around the old homestead - the heartache of our granny being a slave out on our own country, the heartache of our father being fed in the water yard with the rest of the stockmen, the heartache of all our old people being out there on rations."

## The Long Walk Home

In 1994, the Traditional Owners lodged their land claim. For 18 years, the family fought to have their connection to country legally recognised. Max Bloomfield remembers that time with deep respect: "Being part of the 1994 land claim was a privilege and unique experience. Family members listened to stories about the land and its significance, with traditional songs and dances sung around the campfire each night showing great respect for their land and heritage."

Then, in July 2012, the moment arrived. The Land Title was handed back to the Traditional Owners.

"That day was remarkable for all Loves Creek families," Max recalls. "Though sadly many elders were not there to witness this historic moment. Our elders would have been very proud of achieving land rights."

## A Vision for the Future

Today, Kristy and her family are working to restore the homestead and build something their old people would be proud of - not just preserving history, but creating a living, thriving future on country.

"We're in a position to make change and bring that generational wealth to our families on Aboriginal land," Kristy explains. "We want to be part of the cattle industry, which is a multimillion-dollar business. We want meaningful training development programs for our young people to gain employment out on the stock camp, out on these stations across the country."

The vision extends beyond cattle. Atnarpa is becoming a cultural tourism destination where the family can share their heritage with visitors from around the world. The homestead features camping facilities, accommodation blocks, and spaces for tents and campervans. But more importantly, it offers something money can't buy: the opportunity to hear directly from Traditional Owners about their connection to country, their history, and their hopes for the future.

## Healing Through Connection

For the young people Oonchiumpa works with, Atnarpa has become a place of transformation. On one memorable trip, three young Aboriginal men traveled to the homestead for a healing and connection to country experience. They arrived during a cultural tour for 29 interstate students, witnessing firsthand the power of sharing traditional knowledge.

One young man, Malachi, was particularly moved. Encouraged by his peers around the fire pit while cooking kangaroo tails, he began to explore his own cultural connections. The conversation reminded him that his family had established their own school to teach a language on the brink of extinction.

Following that experience, Malachi returned to his own country with extended family members and became involved in hosting visitors and teaching about his homeland. The change in his behavior and sense of empowerment was profound - a testament to what happens when young people connect with country and see Aboriginal people leading with cultural authority.

## A Complex Pride

When Kristy speaks about the homestead, there's both pain and pride in her voice. "We wanna be able to share both sides of our history out there," she says. "Yes, some history isn't great, but our strength and where we've gotten to is that amazing history of our Aboriginal history out there. Our connection to our country, our sacred sites around the area."

"We want our guests to hear our hopes and dreams and our continued connection with the country and with our family members out there as well."

This is what self-determination looks like on the ground - not just words in a policy document, but Traditional Owners rebuilding on their own land, creating employment for their young people, and sharing their culture on their own terms.

## The Legacy Continues

The Bloomfield/Wiltshire family's journey from land claim in 1994 to Native Title in 2012, and now to building a sustainable cultural tourism and cattle operation, demonstrates what Aboriginal communities can achieve when they have control over their own lands and futures.

"We know what we wanna do on our land, and we know how to get there," Kristy says with quiet determination. "It's just about having our land councils, our government supporting us in delivering this and having culturally led programs with our own generational wealth on our land."

"Self-determination for us as Aboriginal people, as our old people have led the way for us."

At Atnarpa, that self-determination is taking root in the red earth, growing stronger with each passing season.

      "Learning Law from the Land: When Legal Education Meets Cultural Authority",
    excerpt:
      "How ANU law students are discovering that the best lessons about justice happen on country, not in lecture halls, through Oonchiumpa's transformative annual program.",
    content: `There's a moment that Chelsea Kenneally, a law student from ANU, keeps coming back to. She's sitting on country in Central Australia, not in a formal lecture theater, and Traditional Owners are sharing knowledge with her cohort.

"They're not lecturing at us in this formal sense," Chelsea reflects. "They're sitting on the same level, conversing with us. That's so beautiful because it comes from their passion for knowledge being passed down to them and now passing it on to us."

This is Oonchiumpa's annual law program - now in its fourth year - and it's transforming how future lawyers, policymakers, and government officials understand justice in Aboriginal Australia.

## A Different Kind of Legal Education

For Adelaide Hayes, coming to the end of her law degree, the choice to participate was deliberate: "I wanted an experience that was genuinely enriching, genuinely challenging, and genuinely subversive."

What she found exceeded expectations. "Working with elders and hearing their call to action has been transformative."

The program brings law students from the Australian National University - many of whom will go on to work in policy, judiciary, or government roles - to Alice Springs and onto country. But this isn't a tourist experience or a superficial "cultural awareness" training. It's an invitation into genuine relationship and deep learning.

Kristy Bloomfield, who leads the program with Oonchiumpa, explains the vision: "These young students are passionate. These young students have been working within government in Canberra. A lot of those students are in roles now making decisions for Central Australia. So it is really meaningful to have these young lawyers hear firsthand from our perspective here and not listening to the media narrative."

## Beyond the Categories

Suzie Ma, in her fifth year studying law and accounting at ANU, puts her finger on something crucial: "The law reduces people to categories and makes things really simplistic when in reality they're not. Being on this country with these stunning views and learning our true history changes everything."

This is the shift that Oonchiumpa facilitates - from abstract legal categories to complex relational understanding. From simplified interventions to nuanced, culturally-grounded approaches.

Aidan Harris, studying law and public policy, emphasizes the stakes: "Learning about Aboriginal conceptions of law and kinship systems has been incredible. This program is so important for anyone going into a policy or legal role in government."

He's right to emphasize the importance. Some of Australia's most harmful policies toward Aboriginal people have come from well-meaning ignorance - from people who simply didn't understand kinship systems, cultural authority, or the complexity of Aboriginal law and governance.

## A Unique Approach

What makes Oonchiumpa's program different from other cultural education initiatives is its foundation in cultural authority. Kristy and her family are Traditional Owners. They're not intermediaries or translators - they're speaking from their own authority about their own country.

"Coming from a cultural authority perspective, we're able to lead this youth space and lead most of our programs and services," Kristy explains. "From my father's side as an Eastern Arrernte man and coming from a traditional owner perspective from Loves Creek, we're able to expand on having that authority as well and to utilize this country we have out there."

The program doesn't just teach students about Aboriginal perspectives - it invites them into relationship with Traditional Owners who are actively leading change in Central Australia. Students hear from elders, from language groups across the region, from men's and women's perspectives, from people working on the front lines of youth services, education, and community development.

## The Fourth Year and Beyond

This year marks the fourth iteration of the program, and Kristy notes a significant shift from the early days: "Going into the fourth year compared to the first year starting off was very challenging because we had to go through barriers in terms of management. But the last two courses, we've been pretty successful in terms of not having that management to deal with, which has been easier for us."

The success is evident. Students consistently describe the experience as transformative. More importantly, relationships are being built between future policymakers and the communities their decisions will affect.

"We definitely wanna be able to continue this partnership with ANU," Kristy says. "Being in Canberra where parliament is, these young students are passionate and many of them are going into roles making decisions for Central Australia."

The vision extends beyond ANU. "We've been asked by students whose parents are part of other universities that are interested as well," Kristy notes. "We're definitely open to having those students and those other university partnerships. We've also spoken to hosting the Aboriginal judges, judiciary as well. These are things that we wanna be able to share - our knowledge and our experience and our elders' stories and our struggles."

## What Students Take Home

The students leave Central Australia with more than academic knowledge. They leave with relationships, with questions, with a fundamentally different understanding of what justice could look like in Australia.

As Chelsea observes, the relational approach to learning matters: "That conversational style, sitting on the same level - it shows respect for how knowledge should be transmitted."

Adelaide found something she hadn't encountered in her formal legal education: "The call to action from elders - it challenges everything we think we know about law and policy."

And Aidan understands he's received something rare: "Understanding Aboriginal conceptions of law and kinship - this isn't taught in law school, but it's essential for anyone working in policy or legal roles affecting Indigenous communities."

## The Real Lesson

Perhaps the most important lesson isn't about Aboriginal law or culture - it's about listening. About sitting on country and receiving knowledge with humility. About understanding that the lecture hall doesn't hold all the answers, especially when it comes to questions of justice for Aboriginal people.

As Kristy puts it: "We wanna change that narrative. We want people to hear firsthand from our perspective, not listening to the media narrative."

The legal system has been "a bit far behind," Kristy notes, "in terms of having these meaningful training programs, having these meaningful courses for young lawyers and even new lawyers. There's no real meaningful course or program for them to participate in."

Oonchiumpa is filling that gap, one relationship at a time, one cohort of students at a time, on country where the most important lessons have always been taught.

## An Invitation

The program represents what Kristy calls "an opportunity for us to share our self-determination, what we want to be able to create on our communities and our stations and our land. We wanna be able to invite people to see our vision just as much as what they can see out on our land."

For law students, it's an invitation to learn differently. For Traditional Owners, it's an opportunity to shape the next generation of legal and policy thinkers. For Australia, it's a glimpse of what legal education could look like if it was grounded in relationship with the communities law is meant to serve.

"We know there's a lot of cattle industries around, we know that there's a lot of mining industries around," Kristy says. "So how are you going to empower us as Aboriginal people to be sustainable in the future for our next generation?"

The law students who've sat on country, who've listened to elders, who've learned about kinship and cultural authority - they're better equipped to answer that question than those who've only studied in lecture halls.

That's the power of learning law from the land.

    title: "Oonchiumpa is Coming to Sydney: An Invitation to Connect",
    excerpt:
      "October 22-25, 2024: Meet Kristy Bloomfield and Tanya Turner, the leaders behind Central Australia's most innovative culturally-led youth program, at the ConX Launch and throughout their Sydney visit.",
    content: `What does real self-determination look like? What happens when Traditional Owners lead youth programs with cultural authority instead of following mainstream service models? What can we learn from Aboriginal-led initiatives that are actually working?

If you've been asking these questions, here's your chance to find some answers.

Kristy Bloomfield and Tanya Turner from Oonchiumpa are coming to Sydney from October 22-25, and they're inviting people to connect, learn, and explore partnerships.

## Why This Matters

Oonchiumpa isn't just another youth program. It's an Aboriginal-led, culturally-grounded initiative working with young people in Central Australia - a region that often makes headlines for all the wrong reasons. But the stories coming out of Oonchiumpa are different.

These are stories of young people who refuse mainstream caseworkers but engage willingly with Aboriginal-led services. Stories of law students from ANU whose understanding of justice is transformed by learning from Traditional Owners on country. Stories of young men finding healing and identity at Atnarpa Station, connecting with cultural knowledge and seeing Aboriginal people leading successful enterprises on their own land.

Kristy and Tanya come from a place of cultural authority - they're Traditional Owners leading programs on their own terms, challenging systems, building partnerships, and creating pathways for young people that honour kinship, country, and cultural strength.

## What They're Looking For

This isn't a fundraising tour or a speaking circuit. Kristy and Tanya are coming to Sydney to build genuine connections with people and organizations who share their vision:

- **Philanthropy partners** who understand that real change comes from supporting Aboriginal-led initiatives rather than imposing external solutions
- **Other youth programs** - particularly First Nations programs - to share learnings, explore collaborations, and build a network of culturally-grounded practice
- **Organizations and individuals** interested in the Oonchiumpa model of cultural authority, kinship-based engagement, and on-country healing
- **Anyone** who wants to understand what's actually working in Central Australia beyond the media narrative

## Join Us for the ConX Launch

The visit kicks off on **October 22nd** with the launch of ConX at Relove - an opportunity to meet Kristy and Tanya in person, hear about their work, and begin conversations about how we can support Aboriginal-led change in Central Australia.

But the invitation extends beyond that single event. From October 22-25, Kristy and Tanya will be available to meet, share stories, and explore how Sydney-based organizations, programs, and individuals might connect with Oonchiumpa's work.

## What You'll Learn

When you meet Kristy and Tanya, you won't get a sanitized presentation or a funding pitch. You'll hear the real story:

- How Oonchiumpa works with young people using cultural authority and kinship connections rather than conventional case management
- The vision for Atnarpa (Loves Creek Station) as a place of healing, employment, and generational wealth for Aboriginal people
- The annual law program that brings ANU students to country to learn from Traditional Owners
- The challenges of leading culturally-grounded programs in a system that often doesn't understand or value Aboriginal ways of working
- The successes - young people transformed, families engaged, community connections strengthened

You'll also learn about their needs. Oonchiumpa is doing transformative work, but like many Aboriginal-led initiatives, they need partners who understand that supporting self-determination means trusting Aboriginal leadership and working on Aboriginal terms.

## The Bigger Picture

This visit is part of something larger - a growing movement of Aboriginal-led organizations across Australia who are proving that when Aboriginal people have authority, resources, and genuine support, incredible things happen.

Kristy speaks clearly about the vision: "We definitely think there's an opportunity for us to share our self-determination, what we want to be able to create on our communities and our stations and our land. We wanna be able to invite people to see our vision just as much as what they can see out on our land."

Sydney has resources, networks, and organizations that could support what's happening in Central Australia. But too often, those resources come with conditions, assumptions, and frameworks that don't fit Aboriginal ways of working. Oonchiumpa is inviting a different kind of partnership - one based on relationship, trust, and genuine commitment to Aboriginal-led change.

## How Different Models Create Different Outcomes

Here's what sets Oonchiumpa apart: young people themselves request to work with them. Families notice that their kids engage differently. One responsible adult shared: "J's other caseworker came out to visit, but J didn't want to work with him - she didn't feel comfortable. But J enjoys working with you two, she works really well. They like working with Oonchiumpa."

Another youth participant put it simply: "I think other kids should work with you mob; I think everyone should work with Oonchiumpa. I like working with you because you mob are good and help."

This is what cultural authority and Aboriginal leadership create - trust where mainstream services have failed, engagement where intervention has been refused, transformation where punishment has only created harm.

## An Invitation to Learn

The truth is, most Australians - even those working in Indigenous affairs, youth services, or policy - have never sat down with Aboriginal Traditional Owners who are leading successful, culturally-grounded programs. Most have never heard firsthand about the challenges, the successes, the vision, and the reality of Aboriginal self-determination in action.

This is your opportunity to change that.

Whether you work in philanthropy, run a youth program, lead a First Nations organization, or simply care about creating real change for Aboriginal young people - Kristy and Tanya's visit offers something rare: the chance to learn directly from Aboriginal leaders who are doing the work, not just talking about it.

## What Happens in the Territory Matters Everywhere

The innovations, learnings, and models being developed through Oonchiumpa's work have implications far beyond Central Australia. How do we engage young people through cultural authority rather than compliance? How do we build programs that honour kinship and country? How do we create pathways to employment and healing that don't require Aboriginal people to disconnect from culture?

These questions matter in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Brisbane, in every place where Aboriginal young people are being failed by systems that don't understand or value Aboriginal ways of being.

Kristy and Tanya are bringing their experience, their stories, and their vision to Sydney. They're opening the door to conversations, partnerships, and connections that could change how we think about youth services, legal education, cultural authority, and self-determination.

## Connect With Oonchiumpa

Kristy and Tanya will be in Sydney from **October 22-25, 2024**.

**Join us for the ConX Launch at Relove on October 22nd** or reach out to arrange a meeting during their visit.

To connect, you can:
- Email Kristy directly: kristy.bloomfield@oonchiumpa.com.au
- Email Tanya directly: tanya.turner@oonchiumpa.com.au

Let them know:
- Who you are and what organization/community you represent
- What draws you to Oonchiumpa's work
- What kind of connection or partnership you're interested in exploring

## What to Expect

Kristy and Tanya lead with cultural authority, speak with honesty, and bring deep knowledge from years of working on the front lines in Central Australia. They're not looking for people who want to "help" Aboriginal communities from a position of expertise. They're looking for partners who understand that Aboriginal people are the experts on their own lives, communities, and futures.

They're looking for people who can sit, listen, learn, and then think about how their resources, networks, or organizations might genuinely support Aboriginal-led change.

If that's you - if you're willing to challenge your assumptions, learn from Aboriginal leaders, and explore what real partnership might look like - then this invitation is for you.

## The Choice Before Us

Australia stands at a crossroads. We can continue down the path of interventions, punitive measures, and deficit narratives about Aboriginal young people. Or we can learn from places like Oonchiumpa where cultural authority, kinship connections, and on-country healing are creating real transformation.

The difference isn't just philosophical - it shows up in measurable outcomes. Young people engaging with services instead of refusing them. Families partnering instead of being alienated. Communities strengthening instead of fracturing.

Kristy and Tanya are coming to Sydney to share what's working, what's needed, and what's possible. The question is: who will show up to listen, learn, and commit to genuine partnership?

We hope to see you October 22-25.
