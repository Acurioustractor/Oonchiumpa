                In 2022, Kristy Bloomfield saw what everyone else saw - young Aboriginal people filling the justice system, making headlines, being failed by programs designed without cultural understanding. But as a Traditional Owner and director, she saw something else: the solution.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Working initially under NAAJA (North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency), Kristy and Tanya Turner began something different. Not another well-meaning program, but leadership rooted in cultural authority, family connections, and the deep truth that these are their kids, their Country, their responsibility.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                The results were immediate. Young people who'd burned bridges with every other service responded to cultural authority. Families who'd given up found hope. The NT Police Operation Luna taskforce saw their list of high-risk youth shrink dramatically.
