# Brave Spaces for Storytelling: Kristy Bloomfield on Deep Listening and True Justice

*How Oonchiumpa's partnership with the Empathy Ledger and ANU is transforming justice through the power of listening*

## Stories and Systems Learning Circle

Storytelling is the connective tissue of systems. It can bridge differences across communities, illuminate hidden dynamics, and reveal patterns that data alone fails to capture. We often ask people to tell their stories. Less often do we ask ourselves if we've built the trust, humility, and patience to listen to them with intention and care.

**Storylistening** - the deliberate, attentive act of receiving stories - can turn stories into transformation. In systems change work, we often focus on outcomes, metrics, and strategy. But we underestimate a quieter, radical force: the act of listening and the power of being heard.

## Creating Trust to Hold Community Stories

Kristy Bloomfield, Traditional Owner and Director of Oonchiumpa in Mparntwe (Alice Springs), recently spoke at the Stories and Systems Learning Circle about how meaningful partnerships are built on deep listening and reciprocity.

The context was challenging. Mparntwe was often demonized in the media for issues relating to youth crime. "The stories portrayed Alice Springs as being a dangerous town and Aboriginal people in a horrible light," recalls Kristy. This led a local judge to introduce Kristy to Benjamin Knight's work at the Empathy Ledger - a revolutionary digital platform that connects storytellers with audiences, organizations, and decision-makers.

### Building Trust Through Presence

Kristy and her fellow Traditional Owner Tanya took Ben on listening tours to understand first-hand how policies have affected people's day-to-day lives. Ben showed up consistently, shared what he was capturing back with the community, and created a relationship of reciprocity.

"A lot of people promise us we can do this for you, or we can do that for you, but it's in one ear and out the other," Kristy reflected. Ben's reliability, consistency, and transparency helped establish the foundations of trust needed to help the community share their stories with agency.

Ben responded:

> "For me, the essence of capturing anything in community is: can I give it to that person? Can they own it? Can they understand where it is going to get used? I'm keen to understand how the things I capture can have deeper impact for the person and that they maintain ownership of the story."

## Storylistening as a Practice of Systems Change

This partnership led to one of Oonchiumpa's most transformative programs: **Legal Education for True Justice: Indigenous Perspectives and Deep Listening on Country** - a collaboration with the Australian National University and the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency.

### A Revolutionary Approach to Legal Education

The key design feature of the True Justice course is radical: the university positions itself as a **listening institution** and is not responsible for course content. Rather, it shares power, and the content is set by Kristy, Tanya, and other Indigenous speakers based on their experience and perspectives on law and justice through their decades of work in Mparntwe.

The purpose of the course is to offer law students the ability to develop their deep listening capacity, to shape their view on systems as they move through their careers. The course is now being shared with judges and senior public servants.

"It's about having empathy with our young people and their lives," says Kristy.

### Listening to Understand, Not to Respond

As one senior public servant explained in CPI's report on Storytelling for Systems Change:

> "In government, we tend to listen to respond. Listening to understand is not this. Listening to understand is grounded in humility, empathy, and heart. It means listening with curiosity and suspending our habits of judgement."

This is exactly what Kristy and Tanya teach through the True Justice program - helping future lawyers, policy-makers, and leaders understand that **storylistening is as important as storytelling**.

## Practices for Cultivating Brave Spaces

When asked for advice on creating brave spaces for storytelling within communities, Ben and Kristy offered these insights:

**From Ben:**
Finding ways to spend meaningful time in place is essential to build relationships with the right knowledge holders. "The most connected people with the best stories [in communities] are often the ones you can't find online." Building ongoing relationships with communities has been key to the work of the Empathy Ledger.

**From Kristy:**
Reciprocity and partnership are key. "We invite people to come on the journey with us. We want to continue partnerships of mutual growth and learning."

## The Power of Being Heard

Kristy's work demonstrates that when we create the conditions for deep listening - when we position ourselves as learners rather than experts, when we share power rather than extract stories, when we build trust through consistency and reciprocity - transformation becomes possible.

This is the foundation of Oonchiumpa's approach to youth mentorship, the True Justice program, and all of our work in Central Australia. We don't just tell stories. We create the brave spaces where stories can be heard, held with care, and transformed into action.
