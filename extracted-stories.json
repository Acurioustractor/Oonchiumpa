I told Malachi it's not too late to learn these things of your family background and connection to country, I told him he's in the best position of going back to learn these things because off he's family. Malachi has family that have started to reconnect back to country by opening their own school to teach the next generation of a language that was on the brink of extinction. Malachi had returned onto country with extended family members and demonstrated sharing with non-indigenous students that recently visited he's homelands which I think is an improvement of his behaviour, he wanted to learn he wanted to be a part of knowledge sharing to him so he can be more empowered.
