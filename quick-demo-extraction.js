    story_type: "youth_success",
    summary: "A young person with a history of offending, disconnected from family and culture, engaged with Oonchiumpa through an on-country trip and is now developing a cultural tourism venture on their own country.",
    content: `MS had a history of offending and was disconnected from family supports, culture and identity when commencing with Oonchiumpa. MS had disengaged with all other service providers and was regularly on a search list as his whereabouts could not be ascertained.

MS started working with Oonchiumpa and engaged really well. He was rewarded with an on country trip where he experienced how other Aboriginal people are establishing economic development with cultural tourism on their country.

MS stated he wanted to do that with his mob and through Oonchiumpa's support is now working on a similar tourism venture on his country. This demonstrates the power of on-country experiences and cultural connection in transforming young people's aspirations and futures.`,

    content: `CB understands since becoming a man he has more responsibility and is now becoming more of a role model and leader in the Town Camp. He didn't understand the importance of his cultural role before.

He is now able to reflect on his actions in the past and feel remorse. He knows he can be a leader.

This transformation demonstrates how cultural ceremonies and Oonchiumpa's cultural authority-based approach helps young people understand their place in community and their responsibilities to others.`,

    content: `J would never come into the office without being with other young people or having been picked up by Oonchiumpa staff.

J now will arrange her own transport to come into the office on her own to get supports and "hang out".

This demonstrates how Oonchiumpa creates culturally safe spaces where young people feel comfortable, building the confidence to seek support independently - a critical life skill.`,
