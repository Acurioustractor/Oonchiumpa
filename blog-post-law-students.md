# Learning Law from the Land: When Legal Education Meets Cultural Authority

*How ANU law students are discovering that the best lessons about justice happen on country, not in lecture halls*

---

There's a moment that Chelsea Kenneally, a law student from ANU, keeps coming back to. She's sitting on country in Central Australia, not in a formal lecture theater, and Traditional Owners are sharing knowledge with her cohort.

"They're not lecturing at us in this formal sense," Chelsea reflects. "They're sitting on the same level, conversing with us. That's so beautiful because it comes from their passion for knowledge being passed down to them and now passing it on to us."

This is Oonchiumpa's annual law program - now in its fourth year - and it's transforming how future lawyers, policymakers, and government officials understand justice in Aboriginal Australia.

## A Different Kind of Legal Education

For Adelaide Hayes, coming to the end of her law degree, the choice to participate was deliberate: "I wanted an experience that was genuinely enriching, genuinely challenging, and genuinely subversive."

What she found exceeded expectations. "Working with elders and hearing their call to action has been transformative."

The program brings law students from the Australian National University - many of whom will go on to work in policy, judiciary, or government roles - to Alice Springs and onto country. But this isn't a tourist experience or a superficial "cultural awareness" training. It's an invitation into genuine relationship and deep learning.

Kristy Bloomfield, who leads the program with Oonchiumpa, explains the vision: "These young students are passionate. These young students have been working within government in Canberra. A lot of those students are in roles now making decisions for Central Australia. So it is really meaningful to have these young lawyers hear firsthand from our perspective here and not listening to the media narrative."

## Beyond the Categories

Suzie Ma, in her fifth year studying law and accounting at ANU, puts her finger on something crucial: "The law reduces people to categories and makes things really simplistic when in reality they're not. Being on this country with these stunning views and learning our true history changes everything."

This is the shift that Oonchiumpa facilitates - from abstract legal categories to complex relational understanding. From simplified interventions to nuanced, culturally-grounded approaches.

Aidan Harris, studying law and public policy, emphasizes the stakes: "Learning about Aboriginal conceptions of law and kinship systems has been incredible. This program is so important for anyone going into a policy or legal role in government."

He's right to emphasize the importance. Some of Australia's most harmful policies toward Aboriginal people have come from well-meaning ignorance - from people who simply didn't understand kinship systems, cultural authority, or the complexity of Aboriginal law and governance.

## A Unique Approach

What makes Oonchiumpa's program different from other cultural education initiatives is its foundation in cultural authority. Kristy and her family are Traditional Owners. They're not intermediaries or translators - they're speaking from their own authority about their own country.

"Coming from a cultural authority perspective, we're able to lead this youth space and lead most of our programs and services," Kristy explains. "From my father's side as an Eastern Arrernte man and coming from a traditional owner perspective from Loves Creek, we're able to expand on having that authority as well and to utilize this country we have out there."

The program doesn't just teach students about Aboriginal perspectives - it invites them into relationship with Traditional Owners who are actively leading change in Central Australia. Students hear from elders, from language groups across the region, from men's and women's perspectives, from people working on the front lines of youth services, education, and community development.

## The Fourth Year and Beyond

This year marks the fourth iteration of the program, and Kristy notes a significant shift from the early days: "Going into the fourth year compared to the first year starting off was very challenging because we had to go through barriers in terms of management. But the last two courses, we've been pretty successful in terms of not having that management to deal with, which has been easier for us."

The success is evident. Students consistently describe the experience as transformative. More importantly, relationships are being built between future policymakers and the communities their decisions will affect.

"We definitely wanna be able to continue this partnership with ANU," Kristy says. "Being in Canberra where parliament is, these young students are passionate and many of them are going into roles making decisions for Central Australia."

The vision extends beyond ANU. "We've been asked by students whose parents are part of other universities that are interested as well," Kristy notes. "We're definitely open to having those students and those other university partnerships. We've also spoken to hosting the Aboriginal judges, judiciary as well. These are things that we wanna be able to share - our knowledge and our experience and our elders' stories and our struggles."

## What Students Take Home

The students leave Central Australia with more than academic knowledge. They leave with relationships, with questions, with a fundamentally different understanding of what justice could look like in Australia.

As Chelsea observes, the relational approach to learning matters: "That conversational style, sitting on the same level - it shows respect for how knowledge should be transmitted."

Adelaide found something she hadn't encountered in her formal legal education: "The call to action from elders - it challenges everything we think we know about law and policy."

And Aidan understands he's received something rare: "Understanding Aboriginal conceptions of law and kinship - this isn't taught in law school, but it's essential for anyone working in policy or legal roles affecting Indigenous communities."

## The Real Lesson

Perhaps the most important lesson isn't about Aboriginal law or culture - it's about listening. About sitting on country and receiving knowledge with humility. About understanding that the lecture hall doesn't hold all the answers, especially when it comes to questions of justice for Aboriginal people.

As Kristy puts it: "We wanna change that narrative. We want people to hear firsthand from our perspective, not listening to the media narrative."

The legal system has been "a bit far behind," Kristy notes, "in terms of having these meaningful training programs, having these meaningful courses for young lawyers and even new lawyers. There's no real meaningful course or program for them to participate in."

Oonchiumpa is filling that gap, one relationship at a time, one cohort of students at a time, on country where the most important lessons have always been taught.

## An Invitation

The program represents what Kristy calls "an opportunity for us to share our self-determination, what we want to be able to create on our communities and our stations and our land. We wanna be able to invite people to see our vision just as much as what they can see out on our land."

For law students, it's an invitation to learn differently. For Traditional Owners, it's an opportunity to shape the next generation of legal and policy thinkers. For Australia, it's a glimpse of what legal education could look like if it was grounded in relationship with the communities law is meant to serve.

"We know there's a lot of cattle industries around, we know that there's a lot of mining industries around," Kristy says. "So how are you going to empower us as Aboriginal people to be sustainable in the future for our next generation?"

The law students who've sat on country, who've listened to elders, who've learned about kinship and cultural authority - they're better equipped to answer that question than those who've only studied in lecture halls.

That's the power of learning law from the land.
