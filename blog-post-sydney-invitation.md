# Oonchiumpa is Coming to Sydney: An Invitation to Connect

*October 22-25, 2024: Meet the leaders behind Central Australia's most innovative culturally-led youth program*

---

What does real self-determination look like? What happens when Traditional Owners lead youth programs with cultural authority instead of following mainstream service models? What can we learn from Aboriginal-led initiatives that are actually working?

If you've been asking these questions, here's your chance to find some answers.

Kristy Bloomfield and Tanya Turner from Oonchiumpa are coming to Sydney from October 22-25, and they're inviting people to connect, learn, and explore partnerships.

## Why This Matters

Oonchiumpa isn't just another youth program. It's an Aboriginal-led, culturally-grounded initiative working with young people in Central Australia - a region that often makes headlines for all the wrong reasons. But the stories coming out of Oonchiumpa are different.

These are stories of young people who refuse mainstream caseworkers but engage willingly with Aboriginal-led services. Stories of law students from ANU whose understanding of justice is transformed by learning from Traditional Owners on country. Stories of young men finding healing and identity at Atnarpa Station, connecting with cultural knowledge and seeing Aboriginal people leading successful enterprises on their own land.

Kristy and Tanya come from a place of cultural authority - they're Traditional Owners leading programs on their own terms, challenging systems, building partnerships, and creating pathways for young people that honour kinship, country, and cultural strength.

## What They're Looking For

This isn't a fundraising tour or a speaking circuit. Kristy and Tanya are coming to Sydney to build genuine connections with people and organizations who share their vision:

- **Philanthropy partners** who understand that real change comes from supporting Aboriginal-led initiatives rather than imposing external solutions
- **Other youth programs** - particularly First Nations programs - to share learnings, explore collaborations, and build a network of culturally-grounded practice
- **Organizations and individuals** interested in the Oonchiumpa model of cultural authority, kinship-based engagement, and on-country healing
- **Anyone** who wants to understand what's actually working in Central Australia beyond the media narrative

## Join Us for the ConX Launch

The visit kicks off on **October 22nd** with the launch of ConX at Relove - an opportunity to meet Kristy and Tanya in person, hear about their work, and begin conversations about how we can support Aboriginal-led change in Central Australia.

But the invitation extends beyond that single event. From October 22-25, Kristy and Tanya will be available to meet, share stories, and explore how Sydney-based organizations, programs, and individuals might connect with Oonchiumpa's work.

## What You'll Learn

When you meet Kristy and Tanya, you won't get a sanitized presentation or a funding pitch. You'll hear the real story:

- How Oonchiumpa works with young people using cultural authority and kinship connections rather than conventional case management
- The vision for Atnarpa (Loves Creek Station) as a place of healing, employment, and generational wealth for Aboriginal people
- The annual law program that brings ANU students to country to learn from Traditional Owners
- The challenges of leading culturally-grounded programs in a system that often doesn't understand or value Aboriginal ways of working
- The successes - young people transformed, families engaged, community connections strengthened

You'll also learn about their needs. Oonchiumpa is doing transformative work, but like many Aboriginal-led initiatives, they need partners who understand that supporting self-determination means trusting Aboriginal leadership and working on Aboriginal terms.

## The Bigger Picture

This visit is part of something larger - a growing movement of Aboriginal-led organizations across Australia who are proving that when Aboriginal people have authority, resources, and genuine support, incredible things happen.

Kristy speaks clearly about the vision: "We definitely think there's an opportunity for us to share our self-determination, what we want to be able to create on our communities and our stations and our land. We wanna be able to invite people to see our vision just as much as what they can see out on our land."

Sydney has resources, networks, and organizations that could support what's happening in Central Australia. But too often, those resources come with conditions, assumptions, and frameworks that don't fit Aboriginal ways of working. Oonchiumpa is inviting a different kind of partnership - one based on relationship, trust, and genuine commitment to Aboriginal-led change.

## How Different Models Create Different Outcomes

Here's what sets Oonchiumpa apart: young people themselves request to work with them. Families notice that their kids engage differently. One responsible adult shared: "J's other caseworker came out to visit, but J didn't want to work with him - she didn't feel comfortable. But J enjoys working with you two, she works really well. They like working with Oonchiumpa."

Another youth participant put it simply: "I think other kids should work with you mob; I think everyone should work with Oonchiumpa. I like working with you because you mob are good and help."

This is what cultural authority and Aboriginal leadership create - trust where mainstream services have failed, engagement where intervention has been refused, transformation where punishment has only created harm.

## An Invitation to Learn

The truth is, most Australians - even those working in Indigenous affairs, youth services, or policy - have never sat down with Aboriginal Traditional Owners who are leading successful, culturally-grounded programs. Most have never heard firsthand about the challenges, the successes, the vision, and the reality of Aboriginal self-determination in action.

This is your opportunity to change that.

Whether you work in philanthropy, run a youth program, lead a First Nations organization, or simply care about creating real change for Aboriginal young people - Kristy and Tanya's visit offers something rare: the chance to learn directly from Aboriginal leaders who are doing the work, not just talking about it.

## What Happens in the Territory Matters Everywhere

The innovations, learnings, and models being developed through Oonchiumpa's work have implications far beyond Central Australia. How do we engage young people through cultural authority rather than compliance? How do we build programs that honour kinship and country? How do we create pathways to employment and healing that don't require Aboriginal people to disconnect from culture?

These questions matter in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Brisbane, in every place where Aboriginal young people are being failed by systems that don't understand or value Aboriginal ways of being.

Kristy and Tanya are bringing their experience, their stories, and their vision to Sydney. They're opening the door to conversations, partnerships, and connections that could change how we think about youth services, legal education, cultural authority, and self-determination.

## What to Expect

Kristy and Tanya lead with cultural authority, speak with honesty, and bring deep knowledge from years of working on the front lines in Central Australia. They're not looking for people who want to "help" Aboriginal communities from a position of expertise. They're looking for partners who understand that Aboriginal people are the experts on their own lives, communities, and futures.

They're looking for people who can sit, listen, learn, and then think about how their resources, networks, or organizations might genuinely support Aboriginal-led change.

If that's you - if you're willing to challenge your assumptions, learn from Aboriginal leaders, and explore what real partnership might look like - then this invitation is for you.

## The Choice Before Us

Australia stands at a crossroads. We can continue down the path of interventions, punitive measures, and deficit narratives about Aboriginal young people. Or we can learn from places like Oonchiumpa where cultural authority, kinship connections, and on-country healing are creating real transformation.

The difference isn't just philosophical - it shows up in measurable outcomes. Young people engaging with services instead of refusing them. Families partnering instead of being alienated. Communities strengthening instead of fracturing.

Kristy and Tanya are coming to Sydney to share what's working, what's needed, and what's possible. The question is: who will show up to listen, learn, and commit to genuine partnership?

We hope to see you October 22-25.
