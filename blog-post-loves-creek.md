# Atnarpa: Coming Home to Country at Loves Creek Station

*A story of reclamation, healing, and building generational wealth on Aboriginal land*

---

There's a place east of Alice Springs where the red earth meets the sky, where a homestead built in 1933 stands testament to over a century of Aboriginal connection to country. This is Atnarpa - also known as Loves Creek Station - and it represents something profound: the journey of the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family to reclaim their ancestral lands and their vision for the future.

## The History Lives in the Land

Atnarpa's story begins long before the cattle station was established in 1896. This land has always been home to the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family - a connection maintained through cultural ceremonies and rituals even when they were pushed away from their own country.

The old homestead itself tells a story. Built with rocks from the local area and clay from the swamps around Loves Creek, mixed with spinifex grass as a binder, its 2-foot-thick walls keep the house cool in summer and warm in winter. During World War II, the pioneering operation bred horses for the Indian Remount trade. But for the Aboriginal Bloomfield family working there, it was a complicated place - their own country, yet one where they faced profound injustice.

As Kristy Bloomfield shares: "There's a lot of heartache around the old homestead - the heartache of our granny being a slave out on our own country, the heartache of our father being fed in the water yard with the rest of the stockmen, the heartache of all our old people being out there on rations."

## The Long Walk Home

In 1994, the Traditional Owners lodged their land claim. For 18 years, the family fought to have their connection to country legally recognized. Max Bloomfield remembers that time with deep respect: "Being part of the 1994 land claim was a privilege and unique experience. Family members listened to stories about the land and its significance, with traditional songs and dances sung around the campfire each night showing great respect for their land and heritage."

Then, in July 2012, the moment arrived. The Land Title was handed back to the Traditional Owners.

"That day was remarkable for all Loves Creek families," Max recalls. "Though sadly many elders were not there to witness this historic moment. Our elders would have been very proud of achieving land rights."

## A Vision for the Future

Today, Kristy and her family are working to restore the homestead and build something their old people would be proud of - not just preserving history, but creating a living, thriving future on country.

"We're in a position to make change and bring that generational wealth to our families on Aboriginal land," Kristy explains. "We want to be part of the cattle industry, which is a multimillion-dollar business. We want meaningful training development programs for our young people to gain employment out on the stock camp, out on these stations across the country."

The vision extends beyond cattle. Atnarpa is becoming a cultural tourism destination where the family can share their heritage with visitors from around the world. The homestead features camping facilities, accommodation blocks, and spaces for tents and campervans. But more importantly, it offers something money can't buy: the opportunity to hear directly from Traditional Owners about their connection to country, their history, and their hopes for the future.

## Healing Through Connection

For the young people Oonchiumpa works with, Atnarpa has become a place of transformation. On one memorable trip, three young Aboriginal men traveled to the homestead for a healing and connection to country experience. They arrived during a cultural tour for 29 interstate students, witnessing firsthand the power of sharing traditional knowledge.

One young man, Malachi, was particularly moved. Encouraged by his peers around the fire pit while cooking kangaroo tails, he began to explore his own cultural connections. The conversation reminded him that his family had established their own school to teach a language on the brink of extinction.

Following that experience, Malachi returned to his own country with extended family members and became involved in hosting visitors and teaching about his homeland. The change in his behavior and sense of empowerment was profound - a testament to what happens when young people connect with country and see Aboriginal people leading with cultural authority.

## A Complex Pride

When Kristy speaks about the homestead, there's both pain and pride in her voice. "We wanna be able to share both sides of our history out there," she says. "Yes, some history isn't great, but our strength and where we've gotten to is that amazing history of our Aboriginal history out there. Our connection to our country, our sacred sites around the area."

"We want our guests to hear our hopes and dreams and our continued connection with the country and with our family members out there as well."

This is what self-determination looks like on the ground - not just words in a policy document, but Traditional Owners rebuilding on their own land, creating employment for their young people, and sharing their culture on their own terms.

## The Legacy Continues

The Bloomfield/Wiltshire family's journey from land claim in 1994 to Native Title in 2012, and now to building a sustainable cultural tourism and cattle operation, demonstrates what Aboriginal communities can achieve when they have control over their own lands and futures.

"We know what we wanna do on our land, and we know how to get there," Kristy says with quiet determination. "It's just about having our land councils, our government supporting us in delivering this and having culturally led programs with our own generational wealth on our land."

"Self-determination for us as Aboriginal people, as our old people have led the way for us."

At Atnarpa, that self-determination is taking root in the red earth, growing stronger with each passing season.
