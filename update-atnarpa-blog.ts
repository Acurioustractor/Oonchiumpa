Located east of Alice Springs on the Ross Highway, this historic station tells a story of cultural persistence, colonial history, and the journey toward self-determination.

## The Early Days: Establishment in 1896

Loves Creek Station was established in 1896 as a cattle operation in the heart of Central Australia. For the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family, this wasn't new territory—it was their ancestral country, land they had walked and cared for since time immemorial. The establishment of the station marked the beginning of a complex chapter in their history, where they would work their own country under colonial systems.

The station's remote location, accessible only by 4WD and about 1.5 hours drive from Alice Springs, helped preserve both the landscape and the cultural connections that the family maintained despite the pressures of colonial occupation.

## Building the Homestead: 1933

![The construction of the homestead](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6724062c951303ea116c3371/674d832110556e8afd1e943e_image5.jpg)

In 1933, the old homestead was constructed using materials drawn directly from the surrounding country. The builders used rocks from the local area, clay from the swamps around Loves Creek, and spinifex grass as a natural binder. The result was walls two feet thick that keep the house cool in the scorching Central Australian summers and warm during winter nights.

This construction method wasn't just practical—it represented a deep connection to place, using what the country provided to create shelter that worked with the environment rather than against it.

The original stockyard, predating even the homestead itself, was built with river gum trees from the area. These structures stand today as monuments to both pioneering ingenuity and the Aboriginal labor that made the station function.

## The War Years and Beyond

During World War II, the pioneering operation at Loves Creek took on additional significance. The station bred horses for the Indian Remount trade, contributing to the war effort while continuing its cattle operations. Aboriginal stockmen and women, including members of the Bloomfield family, did the skilled work that kept the station running.

But this era also holds painful memories. As Kristy Bloomfield shares: "There's a lot of heartache around the old homestead—the heartache of our granny being a slave out on our own country, the heartache of our father being fed in the water yard with the rest of the stockmen, the heartache of all our old people being out there on rations."

## The Long Road to Justice

The Bloomfield/Wiltshire family never stopped fighting to have their connection to country legally recognized. In 1994, they lodged their land claim—beginning an 18-year journey through the legal system to reclaim what had always been theirs.

Max Bloomfield remembers those years: "Being part of the 1994 land claim was a privilege and unique experience. Family members listened to stories about the land and its significance, with traditional songs and dances sung around the campfire each night showing great respect for their land and heritage."

The process required the family to prove what they had always known—that this land was theirs, that their connection ran deeper than any colonial title, that their cultural knowledge and practices tied them to this country in ways the legal system struggled to comprehend.

## July 2012: Coming Home

Then came the day they had waited for. In July 2012, the Land Title was handed back to the Traditional Owners—the Bloomfield/Wiltshire family.

"That day was remarkable for all Loves Creek families," Max recalls. "Though sadly many elders were not there to witness this historic moment. Our elders would have been very proud of achieving land rights."

The return of the title meant more than legal ownership. It meant the right to make decisions about their country, to share their stories on their own terms, to build a future for their children on their ancestral lands.

## Restoration and Vision

![Homestead restoration work](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6724062c951303ea116c3371/674d96d279fc1fd8f45a0228_image14.jpg)

Today, the Bloomfield family is working to restore the old homestead, preserving it as a connection point between past and future. The restoration isn't just about maintaining a building—it's about honoring the old people who worked this country, creating a place where their descendants can connect with history, and building infrastructure for a sustainable future.

Atnarpa now offers camping facilities with accommodation blocks, providing visitors with the opportunity to experience this significant place while supporting the family's vision for economic self-determination.

"We're in a position to make change and bring that generational wealth to our families on Aboriginal land," Kristy explains. "We want to be part of the cattle industry, which is a multimillion-dollar business. We want meaningful training development programs for our young people to gain employment out on the stock camp, out on these stations across the country."

## Cultural Tourism on Aboriginal Terms

![Visitors experiencing Atnarpa](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6724062c951303ea116c3371/674d8566aad29cf39b24070f_image26.jpg)

The vision for Atnarpa extends beyond cattle operations to cultural tourism—but tourism on the family's terms. Visitors come to Atnarpa to hear stories directly from Traditional Owners, to understand the complex history of the place, and to witness Aboriginal people succeeding on their own lands.

"We wanna be able to share both sides of our history out there," Kristy says. "Yes, some history isn't great, but our strength and where we've gotten to is that amazing history of our Aboriginal history out there. Our connection to our country, our sacred sites around the area."

This isn't about sanitizing history or presenting a comfortable narrative. It's about truth-telling—sharing the heartache alongside the triumph, the injustice alongside the resilience.

## A Place of Healing and Learning

For the young people Oonchiumpa works with, Atnarpa has become a powerful place of transformation. On country, surrounded by the evidence of their ancestors' strength and their people's ongoing connection to place, young Aboriginal people find something that mainstream services can't provide—a sense of belonging grounded in thousands of years of cultural continuity.

During one memorable visit, young men from Alice Springs traveled to Atnarpa during a cultural tour for interstate students. Witnessing the family share their knowledge and seeing Aboriginal people operating successfully on their own land had a profound impact. One young man, Malachi, was inspired to explore his own cultural connections, eventually returning to his own country and becoming involved in language preservation and cultural tourism on his family's land.

This is the ripple effect of self-determination—when Aboriginal people see others succeeding on country, leading with cultural authority, it opens possibilities they might not have imagined.

## The Future of Atnarpa

The Bloomfield/Wiltshire family's plans for Atnarpa are ambitious but grounded in practical reality. They envision:

- **A thriving cattle operation** that provides employment and income for the family and community
- **Meaningful training programs** where young people can learn station work, gain employment skills, and connect with country
- **Cultural tourism** that brings visitors to experience authentic Aboriginal knowledge and hospitality
- **A preserved homestead** that tells the story of the past while serving as a base for future operations
- **Economic independence** built on their own land, creating generational wealth for their children

"We know what we wanna do on our land, and we know how to get there," Kristy says with quiet determination. "It's just about having our land councils, our government supporting us in delivering this and having culturally led programs with our own generational wealth on our land."

## Self-Determination in Action

Atnarpa Homestead represents what self-determination looks like when it's more than a policy buzzword. It's Traditional Owners making decisions about their land. It's a family building economic opportunities while maintaining cultural connections. It's young people learning that success doesn't require abandoning culture—it can be built on it.

The journey from the 1994 land claim to today's thriving operation demonstrates what Aboriginal communities can achieve when they have control over their lands and futures. The thick walls of the 1933 homestead, built with rocks and clay and spinifex from the country itself, stand as a metaphor for the family's approach—using what they have, what they know, what their ancestors taught them, to build something that will last.

"Self-determination for us as Aboriginal people, as our old people have led the way for us," Kristy reflects.

At Atnarpa, 1.5 hours by 4WD from Alice Springs, that self-determination is taking root in the red earth, growing stronger with each passing season.
